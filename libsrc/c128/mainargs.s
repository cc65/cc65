; Scan a group of arguments that are in BASIC's input-buffer.
; Build an array that points to the beginning of each argument.
; Send, to main(), that array and the count of the arguments.
;
; Command-lines look like these lines:
;
; run
; run : rem
; run:rem arg1 " arg 2 is quoted "  arg3 "" arg5
;
; "run" and "rem" are entokenned; the args. are not.  Leading and trailing
; spaces outside of quotes are ignored.
;
; TO-DO:
; - The "file-name" might be a path-name; don't copy the directory-components.
; - Add a control-character quoting mechanism.
