<H2><A NAME="ss15.1">15.1</A> <A HREF="ca65.html#toc15.1">Structs and unions Overview</A>
</H2>


<P>Structs and unions are special forms of 
<A HREF="ca65-7.html#scopes">scopes</A>.  They
are to some degree comparable to their C counterparts. Both have a list of
members. Each member allocates storage and may optionally have a name, which,
in case of a struct, is the offset from the beginning and, in case of a union,
is always zero.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss15.2">15.2</A> <A HREF="ca65.html#toc15.2">Declaration</A>
</H2>


<P>Here is an example for a very simple struct with two members and a total size
of 4 bytes:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
      .struct Point
              xcoord  .word
              ycoord  .word
      .endstruct
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>A union shares the total space between all its members, its size is the same
as that of the largest member. The offset of all members relative to the union
is zero.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
      .union  Entry
              index   .word
              ptr     .addr
      .endunion
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>A struct or union must not necessarily have a name. If it is anonymous, no
local scope is opened, the identifiers used to name the members are placed
into the current scope instead.</P>
<P>A struct may contain unnamed members and definitions of local structs. The
storage allocators may contain a multiplier, as in the example below:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
      .struct Circle
              .struct Point
                      .word   2         ; Allocate two words
              .endstruct
              Radius  .word
      .endstruct
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss15.3">15.3</A> <A HREF="ca65.html#toc15.3">The <CODE>.TAG</CODE> keyword</A>
</H2>


<P>Using the 
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.TAG">.TAG</A> keyword, it is possible to reserve space
for an already defined struct or unions within another struct:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
      .struct Point
              xcoord  .word
              ycoord  .word
      .endstruct

      .struct Circle
              Origin  .tag    Point
              Radius  .byte
      .endstruct
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Space for a struct or union may be allocated using the 
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.TAG">.TAG</A> directive.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        C:      .tag    Circle
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Currently, members are just offsets from the start of the struct or union. To
access a field of a struct, the member offset has to be added to the address
of the struct itself:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        lda     C+Circle::Radius        ; Load circle radius into A
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This may change in a future version of the assembler.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss15.4">15.4</A> <A HREF="ca65.html#toc15.4">Limitations</A>
</H2>


<P>Structs and unions are currently implemented as nested symbol tables (in fact,
they were a by-product of the improved scoping rules). Currently, the
assembler has no idea of types. This means that the 
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.TAG">.TAG</A> keyword will only allocate space. You won't be able to initialize
variables declared with 
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.TAG">.TAG</A>, and adding an embedded
structure to another structure with 
<A HREF="ca65-11.html#.TAG">.TAG</A> will not make
this structure accessible by using the '::' operator.</P>
