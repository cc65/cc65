HUFFMAN ENCODER/ DECODER     

This Zip-Archive (huffman-1.0.zip) contains the following:

 huffman.c
 decoder.c
 huffman.prg
 decoder.prg
 huffman.txt

huffman.c is the source code for a huffman encoder. It encodes a given file
using huffman codes and writes compressed data into the output file.

decoder.c is the counterpart: it decodes files compressed with the encoder and
writes the uncompressed data to a given output file or - if none is given - to
stdout.

huffman.prg precompiled binary for c64
decoder.prg precompiled binary for c64

huffman.txt is this file.

I achieved compression ratios of about 60%-80% for text files, 70%-90% for gfx
data files using this one. There is almost no compression for binaries
(program files and the like).

both source codes compile under CC65 V2.11.0 and for C64 target. Since there
is rarely system specific code in it it should compile for all other targets
too but i did't try yet. By replacing the <cbm.h> file-I/O with <stdio.h>
file-I/O it should even compile with any C-Compiler for any platform with a
little bit of RAM.

you can do whatever you like with the sources, most likely compile it with
CC65 and use on a C64 ;)
