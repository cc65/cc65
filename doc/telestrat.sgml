<sect>Overview<p>

This file contains an overview of the Telestrat runtime system as it comes with the
cc65 C compiler. It describes the memory layout, Telestrat-specific header files,
available drivers, and any pitfalls specific to that platform.

Please note that Telestrat-specific functions are just mentioned here, they are
described in detail in the separate <url url="funcref.html" name="function
reference">. Even functions marked as "platform dependent" may be available on
more than one platform. Please see the function reference for more
information.

<sect>Binary format<p>

The standard binary output format generated the linker for the Telestrat target
is a machine language program with a 20 bytes header described here : http://orix.oric.org/doku.php?id=orix:header 

This header is used for Telemon 3.0. 

Anyway, for Telemon 2.4, there is no file management, there is no TAPE routine in Telemon, there is no way to load a binary easily. 

Stratsed (the Telestrat operating system) handles files management. Stratsed is loaded to memory from floppy disk. 

There is no tool to insert a binary in a Stratsed floppy disk. 

The only way to load a binary (for Telemon 2.4) is to :
<itemize>
<item>remove the 20 bytes header
<item>download osdk : http://osdk.defence-force.org/index?page=download
<item>use Floppybuilder in OSDK to insert the binary with the tool (please read FloppyBuilder manual to insert your binary, and to start microdisc boot sector when Telestrat starts)
</itemize>

Please note also, that the binary converted into TAP file, will not produce a right stratsed file when tap2dsk and old2mfm are used. You will be in the case that Telestrat/Stratsed crashed when you do "DIR" command.

If you know the Stratsed disk format, please contact the author of this doc.


<sect>Memory layout<p>

In the standard setup, cc65-generated programs use the memory from
&dollar;0801 to &dollar;9800; so, nearly 37K of memory (including the stack) is
available. ROM calls are possible without further precautions.


Special locations:

<descrip>
  <tag/Stack/
  The C runtime stack is located at &dollar;97FF (or &dollar;B3FF), and grows
  downwards.

  <tag/Heap/
  The C heap is located at the end of the program, and grows towards the C
  runtime stack.

</descrip><p>



<sect>Platform-specific header files<p>

Programs containing Telestrat -specific code may use the <tt/telestrat.h/ header file.


<sect1>Telestrat-specific functions<p>

The functions listed below are special for the Telestrat. See the <url
url="funcref.html" name="function reference"> for declaration and usage.

<itemize>
<item>explode
<item>ping
<item>shoot
<item>zap
<item>oups
</itemize>


<sect1>Hardware access<p>

The following pseudo variables declared in the <tt/telestrat.h/ header file do allow
access to hardware located in the address space. Some variables are
structures; accessing the struct fields will access the chip registers.

<descrip>

  <tag><tt/VIA/</tag>
  Access to the VIA (Versatile Interface Adapter) chip is available via the
  <tt/VIA/ variable. The structure behind this variable is explained in <tt/_6522.h/.

</descrip><p>


<sect>Loadable drivers<p>

<sect1>Extended memory drivers<p>

No extended memory drivers are currently available for the Telestrat.


<sect1>Joystick drivers<p>

<descrip>

telemon 2.4 & 3.0 manages joysticks but it had been handled yet.

</descrip>


<sect1>Mouse drivers<p>

<descrip>

Telestrat manages also mouse, but it had been no handled yet in this version.

</descrip>

<sect1>RS232 device drivers<p>

<descrip>

Telestrat has a RS232 port, but it's not used

</descrip>

<sect>Limitations<label id="limitations"><p>

<sect1>Disk I/O<p>

Telemon 3.0 handles fopen, fread, fclose primitives. It means that this function will crash the Telestrat because Telemon 2.4 does not have these primitives.
By the way, Telemon 3.0 uses an extension "ch376 card" which handles sdcard and FAT 32 usb key. In the next version of Telemon, FT DOS, Sedoric, Stratsed will be handled in these 3 primitives (fopen, fread, fclose).

<itemize>
<item>fclose
<item>fopen
<item>fread
</itemize>
