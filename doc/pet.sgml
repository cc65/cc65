<sect>Overview<p>

This file contains an overview of the PET runtime system as it comes with the
cc65 C compiler. It describes the memory layout, PET specific header files,
available drivers, and any pitfalls specific to that platform.

Please note that PET specific functions are just mentioned here, they are
described in detail in the separate <htmlurl url="funcref.html" name="function
reference">. Even functions marked as "platform dependent" may be available on
more than one platform. Please see the function reference for more
information.


<sect>Binary format<p>

The standard binary output format generated by the linker for the PET target
is a machine language program with a one line BASIC stub, which calls the
machine language part via SYS. This means that a program can be loaded as
BASIC program and started with RUN. It is of course possible to change this
behaviour by using a modified startup file and linker config.


<sect>Memory layout<p>

cc65 generated programs with the default setup run with the I/O area and the
kernal and BASIC ROM enabled, which gives a usable memory range of
&dollar;0400 - &dollar;7FFF (32KB machine).
All ROM entry points may be called directly without additional code.

Special locations:

<descrip>
  <tag/Text screen/
  The text screen is located at &dollar;8000.

  <tag/Stack/
  The C runtime stack is located at &dollar;7FFF and growing downwards.

  <tag/Heap/
  The C heap is located at the end of the program and grows towards the C
  runtime stack.

</descrip><p>



<sect>Platform specific header files<p>

Programs containing PET specific code may use the <tt/pet.h/ or <tt/cbm.h/
header files. Using the later may be an option when writing code for more than
one CBM platform, since it includes <tt/pet.h/ and declares several functions
common to all CBM platforms.


<sect1>PET specific functions<p>

There are currently no special PET functions.



<sect1>CBM specific functions<p>

Some functions are available for all (or at least most) of the Commodore
machines. See the <htmlurl url="funcref.html" name="function reference"> for
declaration and usage.

<itemize>
<item>cbm_close
<item>cbm_closedir
<item>cbm_k_setlfs
<item>cbm_k_setnam
<item>cbm_k_load
<item>cbm_k_save
<item>cbm_k_open
<item>cbm_k_close
<item>cbm_k_readst
<item>cbm_k_chkin
<item>cbm_k_ckout
<item>cbm_k_basin
<item>cbm_k_bsout
<item>cbm_k_clrch
<item>cbm_load
<item>cbm_open
<item>cbm_opendir
<item>cbm_read
<item>cbm_readdir
<item>cbm_save
<item>cbm_write
<item>get_tv
</itemize>


<sect1>Hardware access<p>

The following pseudo variables declared in the <tt/pet.h/ header file do allow
access to hardware located in the address space. Some variables are
structures, accessing the struct fields will access the chip registers.

<descrip>

  <tag><tt/PIA1, PIA2/</tag>
  Access to the two PIA (peripheral interface adapter) chips is available via
  the <tt/PIA1/ and <tt/PIA2/ variables. The structure behind these variables
  is explained in <tt/_pia.h/.

  <tag><tt/VIA/</tag>
  The <tt/VIA/ structure allows access to the VIA (versatile interface
  adapter). See the <tt/_6522.h/ header file located in the include
  directory for the declaration of the structure.

</descrip><p>



<sect>Loadable drivers<p>

<sect1>Graphics drivers<p>

No graphics drivers are currently available for the PET.


<sect1>Extended memory drivers<p>

No extended memory drivers are currently available for the PET.


<sect1>Joystick drivers<p>

<descrip>

  <tag><tt/pet-ptvjoy.joy/</tag>
  Driver for the Protovision 4-player adapter contributed by Groepaz. See
  <htmlurl url="http://www.protovision-online.de/hardw/hardwstart.htm"
  name="http://www.protovision-online.de/hardw/hardwstart.htm"> for prices and
  building instructions. Up to two joysticks are supported.

</descrip><p>


<sect1>Mouse drivers<p>

No mouse drivers are currently available for the PET.


<sect1>RS232 device drivers<p>

No serial drivers are currently available for the PET.



<sect>Limitations<p>



<sect>Other hints<p>

<sect1>Passing arguments to the program<p>

Command line arguments can be passed to <tt/main()/. Since this is not
supported by BASIC, the following syntax was chosen:

<tscreen><verb>
    RUN:REM ARG1 " ARG2 IS QUOTED" ARG3 "" ARG5
</verb></tscreen>

<enum>
<item>Arguments are separated by spaces.
<item>Arguments may be quoted.
<item>Leading and trailing spaces around an argument are ignored. Spaces within
      a quoted argument are allowed.
<item>The first argument passed to <tt/main/ is the program name.
<item>A maximum number of 10 arguments (including the program name) are
      supported.
</enum>


<sect1>Program return code<p>

The program return code (low byte) is passed back to BASIC by use of the
<tt/ST/ variable.


<sect1>Interrupts<p>

The runtime for the PET uses routines marked as <tt/.INTERRUPTOR/ for
interrupt handlers. Such routines must be written as simple machine language
subroutines and will be called automatically by the interrupt handler code
when they are linked into a program. See the discussion of the <tt/.CONDES/
feature in the <htmlurl url="ca65.html" name="assembler manual">.


<sect1>Using extended memory<p>

The extended memory at $9000 of the CBM 8x96 may be added to the heap by using
the following code:

<tscreen><verb>
    /* Check for the existence of RAM */
    if (PEEK(0x9000) == POKE(0x9000, PEEK(0x9000)+1)) {
        /* Add it to the heap */
        _heapadd ((void *) 0x9000, 0x2000);
    }
</verb></tscreen>


<sect>Bugs/Feedback<p>

If you have problems using the library, if you find any bugs, or if you're
doing something interesting with it, I would be glad to hear from you. Feel
