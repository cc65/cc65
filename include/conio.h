** This is the direct console interface for cc65. I do not like the function

** conio, and, even if the interface has changed, the names did not.
**
** The interface does direct screen I/O, so it is fast enough for most
** programs. I did not implement text windows, since many applications do
** not need them and should not pay for the additional overhead. It should
** be easy to add text windows on a higher level if needed,
**
** Most routines do not check the parameters. This may be unfortunate but is
** also related to speed. The coordinates are always 0/0 based.
