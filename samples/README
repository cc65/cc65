This directory contains sample programs for the cc65 compiler.

Below is a short description for each of the programs together with a list of
the supported platforms.

Please note:

  * The supplied makefile needs with GNU make. It works out of the box on
    Linux and similar systems. If you're using Windows, you will have to
    compile the programs manually.

  * The makefile specifies the C64 as the default target platform, because all
    of the programs run on this platform. When compiling for another platform,
    you will have to change the line that specifies the target system at the
    top of the makefile.

Name:           fire
Description:	Another graphics demo written by groepaz/hitmen.
Platforms:     	The program is currently only running on the C64, but should
		be portable to the C128 and CBM510 (and maybe more machines).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:           gunzip65
Description:	A gunzip utility for 6502 based machines written by Piotr
                Fusik <fox@scene.pl>.
Platforms:     	Runs on all platforms with file I/O (currently the Atari and
                most Commodore machines).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:	        hello
Description:	A nice "Hello world" type program that uses the conio
		console I/O library for output.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:           mandelbrot
Description:	A mandelbrot demo using integer arithmetic. The demo was
                written by groepaz/hitmen and converted to cc65 using TGI
                graphics by Stephan Haubenthal.
Platforms:	All systems with TGI support. You may have to change the
                driver/resolution definition in the source.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:           mousedemo
Description:	Shows how to use the mouse.
Platforms:     	All systems with mouse and conio support:
		C64, C128

Name:           nachtm
Description:	Plays "Eine kleine Nachtmusik" by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
Platforms:	All systems that have the Commodore SID (Sound Interface
		Device):
		C64, C128, CBM510, CBM610

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:           plasma
Description:	A fancy graphics demo written by groepaz/hitmen.
Platforms:     	The program needs a VIC, so it runs on the following systems:
		C64, C128, CBM510

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:           sieve
Description:	Implements the "Sieve of Eratosthenes" as a way to find all
		prime numbers in a specific number interval. Often used as
		a benchmark program.
Platforms:	All systems with conio and clock support:
		Atari, C16, C64, C128, CBM510, CBM610, PET, Plus/4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:           tgidemo
Description:	Shows some of the graphics capabilities of the "tiny graphics
		interface".
Platforms:	Runs on all platforms that have TGI support:
		C64
