<sect>Overview<p>

od65 is an object file dump utility. It is able to output most parts of
<htmlurl url="ca65.html" name="ca65-generated"> object files in readable form.
Since the contents and format of the object files are not documented
elsewhere and may change at any time, this tool is a portable way to look at
the contents.

Apart from curiosity, most people don't need to use this tool.



<sect>Usage<p>

The od65 utility dumps contents of one or more ca65 generated object file to
standard output. It has no cross-version compatibility, so you have to use
a version that matches the version of ca65 used to create the object files.


<sect1>Command line option overview<p>

The program may be called as follows:

<tscreen><verb>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Short options:
  -h                    Help (this text)
  -H                    Dump the object file header
  -S                    Dump segments sizes
  -V                    Print the version number and exit

Long options:
  --dump-all            Dump all object file information
  --dump-dbgsyms        Dump debug symbols
  --dump-exports        Dump exported symbols
  --dump-files          Dump the source files
  --dump-header         Dump the object file header
  --dump-imports        Dump imported symbols

  --dump-options        Dump object file options
  --dump-segments       Dump the segments in the file
  --dump-segsize        Dump segments sizes

<sect1>Command line options in detail<label id="cmdline-opt-detail"><p>

Here is a description of all the command line options:

<descrip>

  <tag><tt>--dump-all</tt></tag>

  This will output all information, od65 is able to process. The option is a
  shortcut for specifying all the other <tt/--dump/ options.


  <tag><tt>--dump-dbgsyms</tt></tag>

  Dump all debug symbols contained in the object file.


  <tag><tt>--dump-exports</tt></tag>

  Dump all exported symbols contained in the object file.


  <tag><tt>--dump-files</tt></tag>

  Dump the file table contained in the object file.


  <tag><tt>-H, --dump-header</tt></tag>

  Dump the object file header.


  <tag><tt>--dump-imports</tt></tag>

  Dump the list of imported symbols contained in the object file.


  <tag><tt>--dump-lineinfo</tt></tag>

  Dump the line info contained in the object file.


  <tag><tt>--dump-segments</tt></tag>

  Dump the list of segments contained in the object file.


  <tag><tt>--dump-scopes</tt></tag>

  Dump the scope (lexical level) information contained in the object file.


  <tag><tt>-S, --dump-segsize</tt></tag>

  Dump the sizes of all segments contained in the object file. This option is
  quite useful to determine the effect of measures that increase or decrease
  code size.


  <tag><tt>-h, --help</tt></tag>

  Print the short option summary shown above.


  <tag><tt>-V, --version</tt></tag>

  Print the version number of the compiler. When submitting a bug report,
  please include the operating system you're using, and the compiler
  version.
</descrip>


<sect>Input and output<p>

The converter will read one or more object files per invocation and write the
contents in readable format to standard output. Please note that you need to
specify any of the <tt/--dump/ options listed <ref id="cmdline-opt-detail"
name="above">, otherwise no useful output will be generated.
