/* We need a way to output a StrBuf, but on the other side, we don't want to
** switch off gcc's printf format string checking. So we cheat as follows:
** %m (which is a gcc extension and doesn't take an argument) switches %p
** between outputting a pointer and a string buf. This works just one time,
** so each StrBuf needs in fact a %m%p spec. There's no way to apply a width
** and precision to such a StrBuf, but *not* using %p would bring up a warning
** about a wrong argument type each time. Maybe gcc will one day allow custom
** format specifiers and we can change this ...
