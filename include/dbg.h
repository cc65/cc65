** This is the interface to the cc65 debugger. Since many of the functions
** used for the debugger are quite usable even in another context, they
** are declared here.
**
** To use the debugger, just call DbgInit in your application. Once it has
** been called, the debugger will catch any BRK opcode. Use the BREAK macro
** defined below to insert breakpoints into your code.
**
** There are currently a lot of things that cannot be debugged, graphical
** applications are an example. The debugger does not save your screen
** contents, so even your text screen gets destroyed. However, you can
** debug the C and runtime library, even if the debugger is using this
** stuff itself.
**
** Note: When using the debugger, there are some other identifiers with
** external linkage, that start with Dbg. Avoid those names if you use the
** module.
