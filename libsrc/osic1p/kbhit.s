; unsigned char kbhit (void);
;
; The method to detect a pressed key is based on the documentation in
; "Section 3 Programmed Key Functions" in "The Challenger Character Graphics
; Reference Manual"
; We only want to return true for characters that can be returned by cgetc(),
; but not for keys like <Shift> or <Ctrl>. Therefore a special handling is
; needed for the first row. This is implemented by a bit mask that is stored
; in tmp1 and that is set to zero after the first round.
