Pet Tetris V1.3 by Tim Howe, 15 March 2010.

This is probably the last game EVER to be written for the PET!
It is 30% assembly code and 70% C, and has been compiled with
cc65 version 2-12-0.

It requires a 40 column Commodore PET with BASIC 2 ROMS. Unfortunately
it does not run under BASIC 4 (4000 series). This may be something
that I (or someone else) can rectify in due course.

There are 3 versions available:

tetris (the source included here) - This is the standard version and will
run in 16 or 32k (models 3016 or a 3032).

8ktetris - This is a cut down version that fit into 8k (model 3008).

dactetris - This 'mega' version has wave sound effects.
To hear them, you will need an 8-bit DAC connected to the PET USER port.
This version requires a 32k mackine (3032). Email for source.

Latest binaries should be available from
