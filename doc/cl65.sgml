<abstract>
cl65 is the compile &amp; link utility for cc65, the 6502 C compiler. It was
designed as a smart frontend for the C compiler (cc65), the assembler (ca65),
the object file converter (co65), and the linker (ld65).

<sect>Overview<p>

cl65 is a frontend for cc65, ca65, co65 and ld65. While you may not use the
full power of the tools when calling them through cl65, most features are
available, and the use of cl65 is much simpler.


<sect>Basic Usage<p>

The cl65 compile and link utility may be used to convert, compile, assemble
and link files. While the separate tools do just one step, cl65 knows how to
build object files from C files (by calling the compiler, then the assembler)
and other things.

Most of the options have the same meaning than the corresponding compiler,
assembler or linker option. See the documentation for these tools for an
explanation. If an option is available for more than one of the tools, it
is set for all tools, where it is available. One example for this is <tt/-v/:
The compiler, the assembler and the linker are all called with the <tt/-v/
switch.

There are a few remaining options that control the behaviour of cl65:

<descrip>

  <tag><tt>-S</tt></tag>

  This option forces cl65 to stop after the assembly step. This means that
  C files are translated into assembler files, but nothing more is done.
  Assembler files, object files and libraries given on the command line
  are ignored.


  <tag><tt>-c</tt></tag>

  This options forces cl65 to stop after the assembly step. This means
  that C and assembler files given on the command line are translated into
  object files, but there is no link step, and object files and libraries
  given on the command line are ignored.


  <tag><tt>-o name</tt></tag>

  The -o option is used for the target name in the final step. This causes
  problems, if the linker will not be called, and there are several input
  files on the command line. In this case, the name given with -o will be
  used for all of them, which makes the option pretty useless. You
  shouldn't use -o when more than one output file is created.


  <tag><tt>-t sys, --target sys</tt></tag>

  The default for this option is different from the compiler and linker in the
  case that the option is missing: While the other tools (compiler, assembler
  and linker) will use the "none" system settings by default, cl65 will use
  the C64 as a target system by default. This was chosen since most people
  seem to use cc65 to develop for the C64.

  <tag><tt>-Wa options, --asm-args options</tt></tag>

  Pass options directly to the assembler. This may be used to pass options
  that aren't directly supported by cl65. Several options may be separated by
  commas, the commas are replaced by spaces when passing them to the
  assembler. Beware: Passing arguments directly to the assembler may interfere
  with some of the defaults, because cl65 doesn't parse the options passed. So
  if cl65 supports an option by itself, do not pass this option to the
  assembler by means of the <tt/-Wa/ switch.

  <tag><tt>-Wc options, --cc-args options</tt></tag>

  Pass options directly to the compiler. This may be used to pass options
  that aren't directly supported by cl65. Several options may be separated by
  commas, the commas are replaced by spaces when passing them to the
  compiler. Beware: Passing arguments directly to the compiler may interfere
  with some of the defaults, because cl65 doesn't parse the options passed. So
  if cl65 supports an option by itself, do not pass this option to the
  compiler by means of the <tt/-Wc/ switch.

  <tag><tt>-Wl options, --ld-args options</tt></tag>

  Pass options directly to the linker. This may be used to pass options that
  aren't directly supported by cl65. Several options may be separated by
  commas, the commas are replaced by spaces when passing them to the linker.
  Beware: Passing arguments directly to the linker may interfere with some of
  the defaults, because cl65 doesn't parse the options passed. So if cl65
  supports an option by itself, do not pass this option to the linker by means
  of the <tt/-Wl/ switch.

<sect>More usage<p>

Since cl65 was created to simplify the use of the cc65 development
package, it tries to be smart about several things.

<itemize>

<item>	If you don't give a target system on the command line, cl65
	defaults to the C64.

<item>	When linking, cl65 will supply the names of the startup file and
	library for the target system to the linker, so you don't have to do
	that.

<item>	If the final step is the linker, and the name of the output file was
	not explicitly given, cl65 will use the name of the first input file
	without the extension, provided that the name of this file has an
	extension. So you don't need to name the executable name in most
	cases, just give the name of your "main" file as first input file.
</itemize>

The command line is parsed from left to right, and the actual processing tool
(compiler, assembler, ...) is invoked whenever a file name is encountered.
This means that only the options to the left of a file name are in effect when
this file is processed. It does also mean that you're able to specify
different options for different files on the command line. As an example.

<tscreen><verb>
        cl65 -Oirs main.c -O -g module.c
</verb></tscreen>

translates main.c with full optimization and module.c with less optimization
and debug info enabled.

The type of an input file is derived from its extension:

<itemize>
<item>C files: <tt/.c/
<item>Assembler files: <tt/.s/, <tt/.asm/, <tt/.a65/
<item>Object files: <tt/.o/ <tt/.obj/
<item>Libraries: <tt/.a/, <tt/.lib/
<item>GEOS resource files: <tt/.grc/
<item>o65 files: <tt/.o65/, <tt/.emd/, <tt/.joy/, <tt/.tgi/
</itemize>

Please note that the program cannot handle input files with unknown file
extensions.


<sect>Examples<p>

The morse trainer software, which consists of one C file (morse.c) and one
assembler file (irq.s) will need the following separate steps to compile
into an executable named morse:

<tscreen><verb>
	cc65 -g -Oi -t c64 morse.c
	ca65 -g morse.s
	ca65 -g irq.s
	ld65 -o morse -t c64 c64.o morse.o irq.o c64.lib
</verb></tscreen>

When using cl65, this is simplified to

<tscreen><verb>
	cl65 -g -Oi morse.c irq.s
</verb></tscreen>

As a general rule, you may use cl65 instead of cc65 at most times,
especially in makefiles to build object files directly from C files. Use

<tscreen><verb>
	.c.o:
	      	cl65 -g -Oi $<
</verb></tscreen>

to do this.
