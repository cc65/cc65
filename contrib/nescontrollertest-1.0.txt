NESControllerTest-1.0 - NES Controller Input Test
Version 1.0
Written by Paul Hackmann on 12-30-2005.
Developed using cc65 version 2.11.9 and the nes library version 2.11.0, though
a different nes.o file was needed due to a bug.
Tested for the NES using the FCE Ultra Emulator version 0.98.12
This code reads the button states from Joypad 1 and prints which button has
been pressed. The zip file includes the c code, the batch file used for
compilation, and the compiled nes rom file for running in the emulator.
