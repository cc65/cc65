<sect>Overview<p>

This file contains an overview of the VIC20 runtime system as it comes with the
cc65 C compiler. It describes the memory layout, VIC20-specific header files,
available drivers, and any pitfalls specific to that platform.

Please note that VIC20-specific functions are just mentioned here, they are
described in detail in the separate <url url="funcref.html" name="function
reference">. Even functions marked as "platform dependent" may be available on
more than one platform. Please see the function reference for more
information.


<sect>Binary format<p>

The standard binary output format generated by the linker for the VIC20 target
is a machine language program with a one line BASIC stub, which calls the
machine language part via SYS. This means that a program can be loaded as
BASIC program and started with RUN. It is of course possible to change this
behaviour by using a modified startup file and linker config.


<sect>Memory layout<p>

cc65 generated programs with the default setup run with unexpanded memory
(RAM at &dollar;A000 - &dollar;BFFF may be used for the heap),
which gives a usable memory range of &dollar;1000 - &dollar;1DFF.
All ROM entry points may be called directly without additional code.

Special locations:

<descrip>
  <tag/Text screen/
  The text screen is located at &dollar;1E00 (as in the standard setup).

  <tag/Stack/
  The C runtime stack is located at &dollar;1DFF and growing downwards.

  <tag/Heap/
  The C heap is located at the end of the program and grows towards the C
  runtime stack.

</descrip><p>



<sect>Platform-specific header files<p>

Programs containing VIC20-specific code may use the <tt/vic20.h/ or <tt/cbm.h/
header files. Using the later may be an option when writing code for more than
one CBM platform, since it includes <tt/vic20.h/ and declares several functions
common to all CBM platforms.


<sect1>VIC20-specific functions<p>

There are currently no special VIC20 functions.



<sect1>CBM-specific functions<p>

Some functions are available for all (or at least most) of the Commodore
machines. See the <url url="funcref.html" name="function reference"> for
declaration and usage.

<itemize>
<item>cbm_close
<item>cbm_closedir
<item>cbm_k_setlfs
<item>cbm_k_setnam
<item>cbm_k_load
<item>cbm_k_save
<item>cbm_k_open
<item>cbm_k_close
<item>cbm_k_readst
<item>cbm_k_chkin
<item>cbm_k_ckout
<item>cbm_k_basin
<item>cbm_k_bsout
<item>cbm_k_clrch
<item>cbm_load
<item>cbm_open
<item>cbm_opendir
<item>cbm_read
<item>cbm_readdir
<item>cbm_save
<item>cbm_write
<item>get_tv
</itemize>


<sect1>Hardware access<p>

The following pseudo variables declared in the <tt/vic20.h/ header file do allow
access to hardware located in the address space. Some variables are
structures, accessing the struct fields will access the chip registers.

<descrip>

  <tag><tt/VIC/</tag>
  The <tt/VIC/ structure allows access to the VIC (the graphics
  controller). See the <tt/_vic.h/ header file located in the include
  directory for the declaration of the structure.

  <tag><tt/VIA1, VIA2/</tag>
  Access to the two VIA (versatile interface adapter) chips is available via
  the <tt/VIA1/ and <tt/VIA2/ variables. The structure behind these variables
  is explained in <tt/_6522.h/.

  <tag><tt/COLOR_RAM/</tag>
  A character array that mirrors the color RAM of the VIC20 at &dollar;9600.

</descrip><p>



<sect>Loadable drivers<p>

The names in the parentheses denote the symbols to be used for static linking of the drivers.


<sect1>Graphics drivers<p>

No graphics drivers are currently available for the VIC20.


<sect1>Extended memory drivers<p>

No extended memory drivers are currently available for the VIC20.


<sect1>Joystick drivers<p>

The default drivers, <tt/joy_stddrv (joy_static_stddrv)/, point to <tt/vic20-stdjoy.joy (vic20_stdjoy_joy)/.

<descrip>

  <tag><tt/vic20-stdjoy.joy (vic20_stdjoy_joy)/</tag>
  Supports one standard joystick connected to the joysticks port of the VIC20.

  <tag><tt/vic20-ptvjoy.joy (vic20_ptvjoy_joy)/</tag>
  Driver for the Protovision 4-player adapter contributed by Groepaz. See
  <url url="http://www.protovision-online.de/hardw/hardwstart.htm"> for prices and
  building instructions. Up to three joysticks are supported.

</descrip><p>


<sect1>Mouse drivers<p>

No mouse drivers are currently available for the VIC20.


<sect1>RS232 device drivers<p>

No VIC1011 drivers are currently available for the VIC20.



<sect>Limitations<p>



<sect>Other hints<p>


<sect1>Escape code<p>

For an Esc, press CTRL and the <tt/[/ key.


<sect1>Passing arguments to the program<p>

Command-line arguments can be passed to <tt/main()/. Since that is not
supported directly by BASIC, the following syntax was chosen:

<tscreen><verb>
    RUN:REM ARG1 " ARG2 IS QUOTED" ARG3 "" ARG5
</verb></tscreen>

<enum>
<item>Arguments are separated by spaces.
<item>Arguments may be quoted.
<item>Leading and trailing spaces around an argument are ignored. Spaces within
      a quoted argument are allowed.
<item>The first argument passed to <tt/main()/ is the program name.
<item>A maximum number of 10 arguments (including the program name) are
      supported.
</enum>


<sect1>Program return code<p>

The program return code (low byte) is passed back to BASIC by use of the
<tt/ST/ variable.


<sect1>Using extended memory<p>

The extended memory at $A000 may be added to the heap by using the following
code:

<tscreen><verb>
    /* Check for the existence of RAM */
    if (PEEK(0xA000) == POKE(0xA000, PEEK(0xA000)+1)) {
        /* Add it to the heap */
        _heapadd ((void *) 0xA000, 0x2000);
    }
</verb></tscreen>


<sect1>Interrupts<p>

The runtime for the VIC20 uses routines marked as <tt/.INTERRUPTOR/ for
interrupt handlers. Such routines must be written as simple machine language
subroutines and will be called automatically by the interrupt handler code
when they are linked into a program. See the discussion of the <tt/.CONDES/
feature in the <url url="ca65.html" name="assembler manual">.
