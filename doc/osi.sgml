<sect>Overview<p>

This file contains an overview of the Ohio Scientific runtime system as it comes with the
cc65 C compiler. It describes the memory layout, Ohio Scientific-specific header files,
and any pitfalls specific to that platform.

Please note that Ohio Scientific-specific functions are just mentioned here, they are
described in detail in the separate <url url="funcref.html" name="function
reference">. Even functions marked as "platform dependent" may be available on
more than one platform. Please see the function reference for more
information.

<sect>Targets<p>

Currently the target "osic1p" is implemented. This works for the Ohio Scientific
Challenger 1P machine.

<sect>Binary format<p>

The standard binary output format generated by the linker for the osic1p target
is a machine language program.<p>

For uploading into a real machine over the serial port or into an emulator a
program must be converted to a text file that is understood by the 65V PROM
monitor. For this purpose the srec_cat program from the
<url url="http://srecord.sourceforge.net/" name="SRecord">
tool collection can be used.

Care must be taken that the -offset and -execution-start-address options for the srec_cat
program correspond to the start address of the executable.

Example for converting an executable "hello" that was built for the default
start address &dollar;0200 to an uploadable file "hello.c1p":

<tscreen>
srec_cat hello -binary -offset 0x200 -o hello.c1p -Ohio_Scientific -execution-start-address=0x200
</tscreen>

<sect>Memory layout<p>

By default programs compiled for the osic1p target are configured for 32 kB RAM.
The RAM size can be configured via the symbol __HIMEM__.

Special locations:

<descrip>
  <tag/Program start address/
  The default start address is &dollar;0200. The start address is configurable
  via the compiler option --start-addr.

  <tag/Stack/
  The C runtime stack is located at the top of RAM and growing downwards.
  The size is configurable via the symbol __STACKSIZE__. The default
  stack size is &dollar;0400.

  <tag/Heap/
  The C heap is located at the end of the program and grows towards the C
  runtime stack.

  <tag/Video RAM/
  The 1 kB video RAM is located at &dollar;D000. On the monitor only a subset
  of the available video RAM is visible. The address of the upper left corner
  of the visible area is &dollar;D085 and corresponds to conio cursor
  position (0, 0).

</descrip><p>

Example for building a program with start address &dollar;0300, stack size
&dollar;0200 and RAM size &dollar;2000:

<tscreen>
cl65 --start-addr 0x300 -Wl -D,__HIMEM__=$2000,-D,__STACKSIZE__=$0200 -t osic1p hello.c
</tscreen>

<sect>Linker configurations<p>

The ld65 linker comes with a default config file "osic1p.cfg" for the Ohio Scientific
Challenger 1P, which is implicitly used via <tt/-t osic1p/. The
osic1p package comes with additional secondary linker config files, which are
used via <tt/-t osic1p -C &lt;configfile&gt;/.

<sect1>default config file (<tt/osic1p.cfg/)<p>

The default configuration is tailored to C programs.

<sect1><tt/osic1p-asm.cfg/<p>

This configuration is made for assembler programmers who don't need a special
setup.

To use this config file, assemble with <tt/-t osic1p/ and link with
<tt/-C osic1p-asm.cfg/. The former will make sure that correct runtime library
is used, while the latter supplies the actual config. When using <tt/cl65/,
use both command line options.

Sample command line for <tt/cl65/:

<tscreen><verb>
cl65 -o program -t osic1p -C osic1p-asm.cfg source.s
</verb></tscreen>

<sect>Platform-specific header files<p>

Programs containing Ohio Scientific-specific code may use the <tt/osic1p.h/ 
header file. 

<sect1>Ohio Scientific-specific functions<p>

There are currently no special Ohio Scientific functions.

<sect1>Hardware access<p>

There is no specific support for direct hardware access.

<sect>Loadable drivers<p>

There are no loadable drivers available.

<sect>Limitations<p>

<sect1>conio implementation<p>

The conio implementation is complete except for a kbhit() function. 

<sect1>stdio implementation<p>

There is no support for stdio at the moment.

<sect>Other hints<p>

<sect1>Passing arguments to the program<p>

There is currently no support for passing arguments to a program.

<sect1>Program return code<p>

The program return code currently has no effect. When the main() function
finishes, the boot prompt is shown again.
