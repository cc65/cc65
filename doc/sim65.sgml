<abstract>
sim65 is a simulator for 6502 and 65C02 CPUs. It allows to test target
independent code.
</abstract>

<!-- Table of contents -->

<sect>Overview<p>


sim65 is used as part of the toolchain to test 6502 or 65C02 code.
The binary to test should be compiled with <tt/--target sim6502/ or <tt/--target sim65c02/.


<sect>Usage<p>

The simulator is called as follows:

<tscreen><verb>
        Usage: sim65 [options] file [arguments]
        Short options:
          -h                    Help (this text)
          -c                    Print amount of executed CPU cycles
          -v                    Increase verbosity
          -V                    Print the simulator version number
          -x <num>              Exit simulator after <num> cycles

        Long options:
          --help                Help (this text)
          --cycles              Print amount of executed CPU cycles
          --verbose             Increase verbosity
          --version             Print the simulator version number
</verb></tscreen>

sim65 will exit with the error code of the simulated program,
which is limited to an 8-bit result 0-255.

An error in sim65, like bad arguments or an internal problem will exit with <tt/1/.

A timeout from <tt/-x/ will exist with <tt/2/.


<sect1>Command line options in detail<p>

Here is a description of all the command line options:

<descrip>

  <tag><tt>-h, --help</tt></tag>

  Print the short option summary shown above.


  <tag><tt>-c, --cycles</tt></tag>

  Print the number of executed CPU cycles when the program terminates.
  The cycles for the final "<tt>jmp exit</tt>" are not included in this
  count.


  <tag><tt>-v, --verbose</tt></tag>

  Increase the simulator verbosity.


  <tag><tt>-V, --version</tt></tag>

  Print the version number of the utility. When submitting a bug report,
  please include the operating system you're using, and the compiler
  version.


  <tag><tt>-x num</tt></tag>

  Exit simulator after num cycles.
</descrip>


<sect>Input and output<p>

The simulator will read one binary file per invocation and can log the
program loading and paravirtualization calls to stderr.

Example output for the command
<tscreen><verb>
sim65 --verbose --verbose samples/gunzip65
</verb></tscreen>
<tscreen><verb>

<sect>Creating a Test in C<p>

For a C test compiled and linked with <tt/--target sim6502/ the
command line arguments to <tt/sim65/ will be passed to <tt/main/,
and the return value from <tt/main/ will become sim65's exit code.
The <tt/exit/ function may also be used to terminate with an exit code.

Exit codes are limited to 8 bits.

The standard C library high level file input and output is functional.
A sim65 application can be written like a command line application,
providing arguments to <tt/main/ and using the <tt/stdio.h/ interfaces.

Internally, file input and output is provided at a lower level by
a set of built-in paravirtualization functions (<ref id="paravirt-internal" name="see below">).


<sect>Creating a Test in Assembly<p>

Assembly tests may similarly be assembled and linked with
<tt/--target sim6502/ or <tt/--target sim65c02/.
Define and export <tt/_main/ as an entry point,
and the sim65 library provides two ways to return an 8-bit exit code:

<itemize>

<item>Return from <tt/_main/ with the exit code in <tt/A/.

<item><tt/jmp exit/ with the code in <tt/A/.

</itemize>

The binary file has a 12 byte header:

<itemize>

<item>5 byte <bf/signature/: <tt/$73, $69, $6D, $36, $35/ or <tt/'sim65'/

<item>1 byte <bf/version/: <tt/2/

<item>1 byte <bf/CPU type/: <tt/0/ = 6502, <tt/1/ = 65C02

<item>1 byte <bf/sp address/: the zero page address of the C parameter stack pointer <tt/sp/ used by the paravirtualization functions

<item>1 word <bf/load address/: where to load the data from the file into memory (default: <tt/$0200/)

<item>1 word <bf/reset address/: specifies where to begin execution after loading (default: <tt/$0200/)

</itemize>

Other internal details:

<itemize>

<item>The entire 64 kilobyte address space is writeable RAM.
Aside from the loaded binary, the reset vector at <tt/$FFFC/ will be
pre-loaded with the given <bf/reset address/.

<item>The <tt/exit/ address is <tt/$FFF9/.
Jumping to this address will terminate execution with the A register value as an exit code.

<label id="paravirt-internal">
<item>Several bytes immediately below the vector table are reserved for paravirtualization functions.
Except for <tt/exit/, a <tt/JSR/ to one of these addresses will return immediately after performing a special function.
These use cc65 calling conventions, and are intended for use with the sim65 target C library.

<item><tt/IRQ/ and <tt/NMI/ events will not be generated, though <tt/BRK/
can be used if the IRQ vector at <tt/$FFFE/ is manually prepared by the test code.

</itemize>
