 AutoRun 1.5.0 for C64 by Michael McIntosh

 A small program that executes itself immediately after
 being loaded. This program loads and executes a
 program specified by the coder. To experience to 
 auto-run behavior you must load the file using LOAD with
 a ",8,1" suffix. If you use only ",8" you must type
 RUN manually, as is normal with a program loaded into
 basic memory space. 

 The most common use of a program like this would be
 to make it the first file on a disk and instruct 
 end-users to load it using LOAD "*",8,1. The end-user 
 doesn't have to type RUN after it loads, it just starts. 
 Many professional games, demos and utilities used this 
 technique to display messages and graphics while the 
 main program is loading.

 There are two very simple configuration items that you
 can change at the top of the autorun.s source file
 that specify the program to load and the address of
 the program to execute. 

 This code is public domain and you may do whatever you
 want with the source.

 Special Thanks To:

 MagerValp for his nice loadkoala code that is used on 
 the demo disk image. 

 Assassin of Willow for his piece of art titled 
 "Tentacle" that is used on the demo disk image. 
 
 Greg King for his assembly code size optimization
 suggestions. 

 Uz for his help in locating C64 basic error message 
 routines and his continuing work on the cc65 
 compiler. 

 Developed using cc65 version 2.9.0.
