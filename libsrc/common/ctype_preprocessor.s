; ctype_preprocessor(int c)
;
; converts a character to test via the is*-functions to the matching ctype-masks 
; If c is out of the 8-bit range, the function returns with carry set and accu cleared.
; Return value is in accu and x has to be always clear when returning
; (makes calling code shorter)!
;
; IMPORTANT: stricmp, strlower, strnicmp, strupper and atoi rely that Y is not changed
; while calling this function!
