<P>The ld65 linker combines several object modules created by the ca65
assembler, producing an executable file. The object modules may be read
from a library created by the ar65 archiver (this is somewhat faster and
more convenient). The linker was designed to be as flexible as possible.
It complements the features that are built into the ca65 macroassembler:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>    Accept any number of segments to form an executable module.
</LI>
<LI>    Resolve arbitrary expressions stored in the object files.
</LI>
<LI>    In case of errors, use the meta information stored in the object files
to produce helpful error messages. In case of undefined symbols,
expression range errors, or symbol type mismatches, ld65 is able to
tell you the exact location in the original assembler source, where
the symbol was referenced.
</LI>
<LI>    Flexible output. The output of ld65 is highly configurable by a config
file. Some more-common platforms are supported by default configurations
that may be activated by naming the target system. The output
generation was designed with different output formats in mind, so
adding other formats shouldn't be a great problem.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2</A> <A HREF="#toc2.2">Command-line options in detail</A>
</H2>


<P>Here is a description of all of the command-line options:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<A NAME="option--start-group"></A> </P>
<DT><B><CODE>-(, --start-group</CODE></B><DD>
<P>Start a library group. The libraries specified within a group are searched
multiple times to resolve crossreferences within the libraries. Normally,
crossreferences are resolved only within a library, that is the library is
searched multiple times. Libraries specified later on the command line
cannot reference otherwise unreferenced symbols in libraries specified
earlier, because the linker has already handled them. Library groups are
a solution for this problem, because the linker will search repeatedly
through all libraries specified in the group, until all possible open
symbol references have been satisfied.</P>


<DT><B><CODE>-), --end-group</CODE></B><DD>
<P>End a library group. See the explanation of the <CODE>
<A HREF="#option--start-group">--start-group</A></CODE> option.</P>


<DT><B><CODE>-h, --help</CODE></B><DD>
<P>Print the short option summary shown above.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="option-m"></A> </P>
<DT><B><CODE>-m name, --mapfile name</CODE></B><DD>
<P>This option (which needs an argument that will used as a filename for
the generated map file) will cause the linker to generate a map file.
The map file does contain a detailed overview over the modules used, the
sizes for the different segments, and a table containing exported
symbols.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="option-o"></A> </P>
<DT><B><CODE>-o name</CODE></B><DD>
<P>The -o switch is used to give the name of the default output file.
Depending on your output configuration, this name <EM>might not</EM> be used as the
name for the output file. However, for the default configurations, this
name is used for the output file name.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="option-t"></A> </P>
<DT><B><CODE>-t sys, --target sys</CODE></B><DD>
<P>The argument for the -t switch is the name of the target system. Since this
switch will activate a default configuration, it may not be used together
with the <CODE>
<A HREF="#option-C">-C</A></CODE> option. The following target
systems are currently supported:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>none</LI>
<LI>module</LI>
<LI>apple2</LI>
<LI>apple2enh</LI>
<LI>atari</LI>
<LI>atarixl</LI>
<LI>atmos</LI>
<LI>c16 (works also for the c116 with memory up to 32K)</LI>
<LI>c64</LI>
<LI>c128</LI>
<LI>cbm510 (CBM-II series with 40-column video)</LI>
<LI>cbm610 (all CBM series-II computers with 80-column video)</LI>
<LI>geos-apple</LI>
<LI>geos-cbm</LI>
<LI>lunix</LI>
<LI>lynx</LI>
<LI>nes</LI>
<LI>pet (all CBM PET systems except the 2001)</LI>
<LI>plus4</LI>
<LI>sim6502</LI>
<LI>sim65c02</LI>
<LI>supervision</LI>
<LI>vic20</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>There are a few more targets defined but neither of them is actually
supported.</P>


<DT><B><CODE>-u sym[:addrsize], --force-import sym[:addrsize]</CODE></B><DD>
<P>Force an import of a symbol. While object files are always linked to the
output file, regardless if there are any references, object modules from
libraries get only linked in if an import can be satisfied by this module.
The <CODE>--force-import</CODE> option may be used to add a reference to a symbol and
as a result force linkage of the module that exports the identifier.</P>
<P>The name of the symbol may optionally be followed by a colon and an address-size
specifier. If no address size is specified, the default address size
for the target machine is used.</P>
<P>Please note that the symbol name needs to have the internal representation,
meaning you have to prepend an underscore for C identifiers.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="option-v"></A> </P>
<DT><B><CODE>-v, --verbose</CODE></B><DD>
<P>Using the -v option, you may enable more output that may help you to
locate problems. If an undefined symbol is encountered, -v causes the
linker to print a detailed list of the references (that is, source file
and line) for this symbol.</P>


<DT><B><CODE>-vm</CODE></B><DD>
<P>Must be used in conjunction with <CODE>
<A HREF="#option-m">-m</A></CODE>
(generate map file). Normally the map file will not include empty segments
and sections, or unreferenced symbols. Using this option, you can force the
linker to include all that information into the map file.  Also, it will
include a second <CODE>Exports</CODE> list.  The first list is sorted by name;
the second one is sorted by value.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="option-C"></A> </P>
<DT><B><CODE>-C</CODE></B><DD>
<P>This gives the name of an output config file to use. See section 4 for more
information about config files. -C may not be used together with <CODE>
<A HREF="#option-t">-t</A></CODE>.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="option-D"></A> </P>
<DT><B><CODE>-D sym=value, --define sym=value</CODE></B><DD>
<P>This option allows to define an external symbol on the command line. Value
may start with a '$' sign or with <CODE>0x</CODE> for hexadecimal values,
otherwise a leading zero denotes octal values. See also 
<A HREF="#SYMBOLS">the SYMBOLS section</A> in the configuration file.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="option--lib-path"></A> </P>
<DT><B><CODE>-L path, --lib-path path</CODE></B><DD>
<P>Specify a library search path. This option may be used more than once. It
adds a directory to the search path for library files. Libraries specified
without a path are searched in the current directory, in the list of
directories specified using <CODE>--lib-path</CODE>, in directories given by
environment variables, and in a built-in default directory.</P>


<DT><B><CODE>-Ln</CODE></B><DD>
<P>This option allows you to create a file that contains all global labels and
may be loaded into the VICE emulator using the <CODE>ll</CODE> (load label) command. You
may use this to debug your code with VICE. Note: Older versions had some
bugs in the label code. If you have problems, please get the latest 
<A HREF="http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/">VICE</A> version.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="option-S"></A> </P>
<DT><B><CODE>-S addr, --start-addr addr</CODE></B><DD>
<P>Using -S you may define the default starting address. If and how this
address is used depends on the config file in use. For the default
configurations, only the "none", "apple2" and "apple2enh" systems honor an
explicit start address, all other default configs provide their own.</P>


<DT><B><CODE>-V, --version</CODE></B><DD>
<P>This option prints the version number of the linker. If you send any
suggestions or bugfixes, please include this number.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="option--cfg-path"></A> </P>
<DT><B><CODE>--cfg-path path</CODE></B><DD>
<P>Specify a config file search path. This option may be used more than once.
It adds a directory to the search path for config files. A config file given
with the <CODE>
<A HREF="#option-C">-C</A></CODE> option that has no path in
its name is searched in the current directory, in the list of directories
specified using <CODE>--cfg-path</CODE>, in directories given by environment variables,
and in a built-in default directory.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="option--dbgfile"></A> </P>
<DT><B><CODE>--dbgfile name</CODE></B><DD>
<P>Specify an output file for debug information. Available information will be
written to this file. Using the <CODE>-g</CODE> option for the compiler and assembler
will increase the amount of information available. Please note that debug
information generation is currently being developed, so the format of the
file and its contents are subject to change without further notice.</P>


<DT><B><CODE>--lib file</CODE></B><DD>
<P>Links a library to the output. Use this command-line option instead of just
naming the library file, if the linker is not able to determine the file
type because of an unusual extension.</P>


<DT><B><CODE>--obj file</CODE></B><DD>
<P>Links an object file to the output. Use this command-line option instead
of just naming the object file, if the linker is not able to determine the
file type because of an unusual extension.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="option--obj-path"></A> </P>
<DT><B><CODE>--obj-path path</CODE></B><DD>
<P>Specify an object file search path. This option may be used more than once.
It adds a directory to the search path for object files. An object file
passed to the linker that has no path in its name is searched in the current
directory, in the list of directories specified using <CODE>--obj-path</CODE>, in
directories given by environment variables, and in a built-in default directory.</P>

</DL>

<H2><A NAME="s4">4.</A> <A HREF="#toc4">Detailed workings</A></H2>


<P>The linker does several things when combining object modules:</P>
<P>First, the command line is parsed from left to right. For each object file
encountered (object files are recognized by a magic word in the header, so
the linker does not care about the name), imported and exported
identifiers are read from the file and inserted in a table. If a library
name is given (libraries are also recognized by a magic word, there are no
special naming conventions), all modules in the library are checked if an
export from this module would satisfy an import from other modules. All
modules where this is the case are marked. If duplicate identifiers are
found, the linker issues warnings.</P>
<P>That procedure (parsing and reading from left to right) does mean that a
library may only satisfy references for object modules (given directly or from
a library) named <EM>before</EM> that library. With the command line</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        ld65 crt0.o clib.lib test.o
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>the module <CODE>test.o</CODE> must not contain references to modules in the library
<CODE>clib.lib</CODE>.  But, if it does, you have to change the order of the modules
on the command line:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        ld65 crt0.o test.o clib.lib
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Step two is, to read the configuration file, and assign start addresses
for the segments and define any linker symbols (see 
<A HREF="#config-files">Configuration files</A>).</P>
<P>After that, the linker is ready to produce an output file. Before doing that,
it checks its data for consistency. That is, it checks for unresolved
externals (if the output format is not relocatable) and for symbol type
mismatches (for example a zero-page symbol is imported by a module as an absolute
symbol).</P>
<P>Step four is, to write the actual target files. In this step, the linker will
resolve any expressions contained in the segment data. Circular references are
also detected in this step (a symbol may have a circular reference that goes
unnoticed if the symbol is not used).</P>
<P>Step five is to output a map file with a detailed list of all modules,
segments and symbols encountered.</P>
<P>And, last step, if you give the <CODE>
<A HREF="#option-v">-v</A></CODE> switch
twice, you get a dump of the segment data. However, this may be quite
unreadable if you're not a developer. :-)</P>



<H2><A NAME="config-files"></A> <A NAME="s5">5.</A> <A HREF="#toc5">Configuration files</A></H2>


<P>Configuration files are used to describe the layout of the output file(s). Two
major topics are covered in a config file: The memory layout of the target
architecture, and the assignment of segments to memory areas. In addition,
several other attributes may be specified.</P>
<P>Case is ignored for keywords, that is, section or attribute names, but it is
<EM>not</EM> ignored for names and strings.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1</A> <A HREF="#toc5.1">Memory areas</A>
</H2>


<P>Memory areas are specified in a <CODE>MEMORY</CODE> section. Let's have a look at an
example (this one describes the usable memory layout of the C64):</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        MEMORY {
            RAM1:  start = $0800, size = $9800;
            ROM1:  start = $A000, size = $2000;
            RAM2:  start = $C000, size = $1000;
            ROM2:  start = $E000, size = $2000;
        }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>As you can see, there are two RAM areas and two ROM areas. The names
(before the colon) are arbitrary names that must start with a letter, with
the remaining characters being letters or digits. The names of the memory
areas are used when assigning segments. As mentioned above, case is
significant for those names.</P>
<P>The syntax above is used in all sections of the config file. The name
(<CODE>ROM1</CODE> etc.) is said to be an identifier, the remaining tokens up to the
semicolon specify attributes for this identifier. You may use the equal sign
to assign values to attributes, and you may use a comma to separate
attributes, you may also leave both out. But you <EM>must</EM> use a semicolon to
mark the end of the attributes for one identifier. The section above may also
have looked like this:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        # Start of memory section
        MEMORY
        {
            RAM1:
                start $0800
                size $9800;
            ROM1:
                start $A000
                size $2000;
            RAM2:
                start $C000
                size $1000;
            ROM2:
                start $E000
                size $2000;
        }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>There are of course more attributes for a memory section than just start and
size. Start and size are mandatory attributes, that means, each memory area
defined <EM>must</EM> have these attributes given (the linker will check that). I
will cover other attributes later. As you may have noticed, I've used a
comment in the example above. Comments start with a hash mark (`#'), the
remainder of the line is ignored if this character is found.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2</A> <A HREF="#toc5.2">Segments</A>
</H2>


<P>Let's assume you have written a program for your trusty old C64, and you would
like to run it. For testing purposes, it should run in the <CODE>RAM</CODE> area. So
we will start to assign segments to memory sections in the <CODE>SEGMENTS</CODE>
section:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        SEGMENTS {
            CODE:   load = RAM1, type = ro;
            RODATA: load = RAM1, type = ro;
            DATA:   load = RAM1, type = rw;
            BSS:    load = RAM1, type = bss, define = yes;
        }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>What we are doing here is telling the linker, that all segments go into the
<CODE>RAM1</CODE> memory area in the order specified in the <CODE>SEGMENTS</CODE> section. So
the linker will first write the <CODE>CODE</CODE> segment, then the <CODE>RODATA</CODE>
segment, then the <CODE>DATA</CODE> segment - but it will not write the <CODE>BSS</CODE>
segment. Why? Here enters the segment type: For each segment specified, you may also
specify a segment attribute. There are four possible segment attributes:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        ro      means readonly
        rw      means read/write
        bss     means that this is an uninitialized segment
        zp      a zeropage segment
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>So, because we specified that the segment with the name BSS is of type bss,
the linker knows that this is uninitialized data, and will not write it to an
output file. This is an important point: For the assembler, the <CODE>BSS</CODE>
segment has no special meaning. You specify, which segments have the bss
attribute when linking. This approach is much more flexible than having one
fixed bss segment, and is a result of the design decision to supporting an
arbitrary segment count.</P>
<P>If you specify "<CODE>type = bss</CODE>" for a segment, the linker will make sure that
this segment does only contain uninitialized data (that is, zeroes), and issue
a warning if this is not the case.</P>
<P>For a <CODE>bss</CODE> type segment to be useful, it must be cleared somehow by your
program (this happens usually in the startup code - for example the startup
code for cc65-generated programs takes care about that). But how does your
code know, where the segment starts, and how big it is? The linker is able to
give that information, but you must request it. This is, what we're doing with
the "<CODE>define = yes</CODE>" attribute in the <CODE>BSS</CODE> definitions. For each
segment, where this attribute is true, the linker will export three symbols.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        __NAME_LOAD__   This is set to the address where the
                        segment is loaded.
        __NAME_RUN__    This is set to the run address of the
                        segment. We will cover run addresses
                        later.
        __NAME_SIZE__   This is set to the segment size.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Replace <CODE>NAME</CODE> by the name of the segment, in the example above, this would
be <CODE>BSS</CODE>. These symbols may be accessed by your code.</P>
<P>Now, as we've configured the linker to write the first three segments and
create symbols for the last one, there's only one question left: Where does
the linker put the data? It would be very convenient to have the data in a
file, wouldn't it?</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3</A> <A HREF="#toc5.3">Output files</A>
</H2>


<P>We don't have any files specified above, and indeed, this is not needed in a
simple configuration like the one above. There is an additional attribute
"file" that may be specified for a memory area, that gives a file name to
write the area data into. If there is no file name given, the linker will
assign the default file name. This is "a.out" or the one given with the
<CODE>
<A HREF="#option-o">-o</A></CODE> option on the command line. Since the
default behaviour is OK for our purposes, I did not use the attribute in the
example above. Let's have a look at it now.</P>
<P>The "file" attribute (the keyword may also be written as "FILE" if you like
that better) takes a string enclosed in double quotes (`&#34;') that specifies the
file, where the data is written. You may specify the same file several times,
in that case the data for all memory areas having this file name is written
into this file, in the order of the memory areas defined in the <CODE>MEMORY</CODE>
section. Let's specify some file names in the <CODE>MEMORY</CODE> section used above:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        MEMORY {
            RAM1:  start = $0800, size = $9800, file = %O;

            RAM2:  start = $C000, size = $1000, file = %O;
            ROM2:  start = $E000, size = $2000, file = "rom2.bin";
        }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The <CODE>%O</CODE> used here is a way to specify the default behaviour explicitly:
<CODE>%O</CODE> is replaced by a string (including the quotes) that contains the
default output name, that is, "a.out" or the name specified with the <CODE>
<A HREF="#option-o">-o</A></CODE> option on the command line. Into this file, the
linker will first write any segments that go into <CODE>RAM1</CODE>, and will append
then the segments for <CODE>RAM2</CODE>, because the memory areas are given in this
order. So, for the RAM areas, nothing has really changed.</P>
<P>We've not used the ROM areas, but we will do that below, so we give the file
names here. Segments that go into <CODE>ROM1</CODE> will be written to a file named
"rom1.bin", and segments that go into <CODE>ROM2</CODE> will be written to a file
named "rom2.bin". The name given on the command line is ignored in both cases.</P>
<P>Assigning an empty file name for a memory area will discard the data written
to it. This is useful, if the memory area has segments assigned that are empty
(for example because they are of type bss). In that case, the linker will
create an empty output file. This may be suppressed by assigning an empty file
name to that memory area.</P>
<P>The <CODE>%O</CODE> sequence is also allowed inside a string. So using</P>

<P>Let us look now at a more complex example. Say, you've successfully tested
your new "Super Operating System" (SOS for short) for the C64, and you
will now go and replace the ROMs by your own code. When doing that, you
face a new problem: If the code runs in RAM, we need not to care about
read/write data. But now, if the code is in ROM, we must care about it.
Remember the default segments (you may of course specify your own):</P>
<P>

        BSS             uninitialized data, read/write
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Since <CODE>BSS</CODE> is not initialized, we must not care about it now, but what
about <CODE>DATA</CODE>? <CODE>DATA</CODE> contains initialized data, that is, data that was
explicitly assigned a value. And your program will rely on these values on
startup. Since there's no way to remember the contents of the data segment,
other than storing it into one of the ROMs, we have to put it there. But
unfortunately, ROM is not writable, so we have to copy it into RAM before
running the actual code.</P>
<P>The linker won't copy the data from ROM into RAM for you (this must be done by
the startup code of your program), but it has some features that will help you
in this process.</P>
<P>First, you may not only specify a "<CODE>load</CODE>" attribute for a segment, but
also a "<CODE>run</CODE>" attribute. The "<CODE>load</CODE>" attribute is mandatory, and, if
you don't specify a "<CODE>run</CODE>" attribute, the linker assumes that load area
and run area are the same. We will use this feature for our data area:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        SEGMENTS {
            CODE:   load = ROM1, type = ro;
            RODATA: load = ROM2, type = ro;
            DATA:   load = ROM2, run = RAM2, type = rw, define = yes;
            BSS:    load = RAM2, type = bss, define = yes;
        }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Let's have a closer look at this <CODE>SEGMENTS</CODE> section. We specify that the
<CODE>CODE</CODE> segment goes into <CODE>ROM1</CODE> (the one at $A000). The readonly data
goes into <CODE>ROM2</CODE>. Read/write data will be loaded into <CODE>ROM2</CODE> but is run
in <CODE>RAM2</CODE>. That means that all references to labels in the <CODE>DATA</CODE>
segment are relocated to be in <CODE>RAM2</CODE>, but the segment is written to
<CODE>ROM2</CODE>. All your startup code has to do is, to copy the data from its
location in <CODE>ROM2</CODE> to the final location in <CODE>RAM2</CODE>.</P>
<P>So, how do you know, where the data is located? This is the second point,
where you get help from the linker. Remember the "<CODE>define</CODE>" attribute?
Since we have set this attribute to true, the linker will define three
external symbols for the data segment that may be accessed from your code:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        __DATA_LOAD__   This is set to the address where the segment
                        is loaded, in this case, it is an address in
                        ROM2.
        __DATA_RUN__    This is set to the run address of the segment,
                        in this case, it is an address in RAM2.
        __DATA_SIZE__   This is set to the segment size.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>So, what your startup code must do, is to copy <CODE>__DATA_SIZE__</CODE> bytes from
<CODE>__DATA_LOAD__</CODE> to <CODE>__DATA_RUN__</CODE> before any other routines are called.
All references to labels in the <CODE>DATA</CODE> segment are relocated to <CODE>RAM2</CODE>
by the linker, so things will work properly.</P>
<P>There's a library subroutine called <CODE>copydata</CODE> (in a module named
<CODE>copydata.s</CODE>) that might be used to do actual copying. Be sure to have a
look at it's inner workings before using it!</P>

<P>The linker will assure, that no segment marked as read/write or bss is put

<P>Unused memory in a memory area may be filled. Use the "<CODE>fill = yes</CODE>"
attribute to request this. The default value to fill unused space is zero. If
you don't like this, you may specify a byte value that is used to fill these
areas with the "<CODE>fillval</CODE>" attribute. If there is no "<CODE>fillval</CODE>"
attribute for the segment, the "<CODE>fillval</CODE>" attribute of the memory area (or
its default) is used instead. This means that the value may also be used to
fill unfilled areas generated by the assembler's <CODE>.ALIGN</CODE> and <CODE>.RES</CODE>
directives.</P>
<P>The symbol <CODE>%S</CODE> may be used to access the default start address (that is,

<P>To support systems with banked memory, a special attribute named <CODE>bank</CODE> is
available. The attribute value is an arbitrary 32-bit integer. The assembler
has a builtin function named <CODE>.BANK</CODE> which may be used with an argument
that has a segment reference (for example a symbol). The result of this
function is the value of the bank attribute for the run memory area of the

        }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If an alignment is requested, the linker will add enough space to the output
file, so that the new segment starts at an address that is dividable by the
given number without a remainder. All addresses are adjusted accordingly. To
fill the unused space, bytes of zero are used, or, if the memory area has a
"<CODE>fillval</CODE>" attribute, that value. Alignment is always needed, if you have
used the <CODE>.ALIGN</CODE> command in the assembler. The alignment of a segment
must be equal or greater than the alignment used in the <CODE>.ALIGN</CODE> command.
The linker will check that, and issue a warning, if the alignment of a segment
is lower than the alignment requested in an <CODE>.ALIGN</CODE> command of one of the
modules making up this segment.</P>
<P>For a given segment you may also specify a fixed offset into a memory area or
a fixed start address. Use this if you want the code to run at a specific
address (a prominent case is the interrupt vector table which must go at
address $FFFA). Only one of <CODE>ALIGN</CODE> or <CODE>OFFSET</CODE> or <CODE>START</CODE> may be
specified. If the directive creates empty space, it will be filled with zero,
of with the value specified with the "<CODE>fillval</CODE>" attribute if one is given.
The linker will warn you if it is not possible to put the code at the
specified offset (this may happen if other segments in this area are too
large). Here's an example:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The "<CODE>align</CODE>", "<CODE>start</CODE>" and "<CODE>offset</CODE>" attributes change placement
of the segment in the run memory area, because this is what is usually
desired. If load and run memory areas are equal (which is the case if only the
load memory area has been specified), the attributes will also work. There is
also an "<CODE>align_load</CODE>" attribute that may be used to align the start of the
segment in the load memory area, in case different load and run areas have
been specified. There are no special attributes to set start or offset for
just the load memory area.</P>
<P>A "<CODE>fillval</CODE>" attribute may not only be specified for a memory area, but
also for a segment. The value must be an integer between 0 and 255. It is used
as the fill value for space reserved by the assembler's <CODE>.ALIGN</CODE> and <CODE>.RES</CODE>
commands. It is also used as the fill value for space between sections (part of a
segment that comes from one object file) caused by alignment, but not for
space that preceeds the first section.</P>
<P>To suppress the warning, the linker issues if it encounters a segment that is
not found in any of the input files, use "<CODE>optional=yes</CODE>" as an additional
segment attribute. Be careful when using this attribute, because a missing
segment may be a sign of a problem, and if you're suppressing the warning,
there is no one left to tell you about it.</P>

<DT><B><CODE>segment</CODE></B><DD>
<P>This attribute tells the linker into which segment the table should be
placed. If the segment does not exist, it is created.</P>


<DT><B><CODE>type</CODE></B><DD>
<P>Describes the type of the routines to place in the table. Type may be one of
the predefined types <CODE>constructor</CODE>, <CODE>destructor</CODE>, <CODE>interruptor</CODE>, or
a numeric value between 0 and 6.</P>


<DT><B><CODE>label</CODE></B><DD>
<P>This specifies the label to use for the table. The label points to the start
of the table in memory and may be used from within user-written code.</P>


<DT><B><CODE>count</CODE></B><DD>
<P>This is an optional attribute. If specified, an additional symbol is defined
by the linker using the given name. The value of this symbol is the number
of entries (<EM>not</EM> bytes) in the table. While this attribute is optional,
it is often useful to define it.</P>


<DT><B><CODE>order</CODE></B><DD>
<P>An optional attribute that takes one of the keywords <CODE>increasing</CODE> or
<CODE>decreasing</CODE> as an argument. Specifies the sorting order of the entries
within the table. The default is <CODE>increasing</CODE>, which means that the
entries are sorted with increasing priority (the first entry has the lowest
priority). "Priority" is the priority specified when declaring a symbol as
<CODE>.CONDES</CODE> with the assembler, higher values mean higher priority. You may
change this behaviour by specifying <CODE>decreasing</CODE> as the argument, the
order of entries is reversed in this case.</P>
<P>Please note that the order of entries with equal priority is undefined.</P>

<DT><B><CODE>import</CODE></B><DD>
<P>This attribute defines a valid symbol name, that is added as an import
to the modules defining a constructor/destructor of the given type.
This can be used to force linkage of a module if this module exports the
requested symbol.</P>

<CODE>weak</CODE>. <CODE>export</CODE> means that the symbol is defined and exported from
the linker config. <CODE>import</CODE> means that an import is generated for this
symbol, eventually forcing a module that exports this symbol to be included
in the output. <CODE>weak</CODE> is similar as <CODE>export</CODE>. However, the symbol is
only defined if it is not defined elsewhere.</P>

<DT><B><CODE>value</CODE></B><DD>
<P>This must only be given for symbols of type <CODE>export</CODE> or <CODE>weak</CODE>. It
defines the value of the symbol and may be an expression.</P>

</DL>

<P>The following example defines the stack size for an application, but allows
the programmer to override the value by specifying <CODE>--define
__STACKSIZE__=xxx</CODE> on the command line.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s6">6.</A> <A HREF="#toc6">Special segments</A></H2>


<P>The builtin config files do contain segments that have a special meaning for
the compiler and the libraries that come with it. If you replace the builtin
config files, you will need the following information.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1</A> <A HREF="#toc6.1">INIT</A>
</H2>


<P>The INIT segment is used for initialization code that may be reused once
execution reaches main() - provided that the program runs in RAM. You
may for example add the INIT segment to the heap in really memory
constrained systems.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2</A> <A HREF="#toc6.2">LOWCODE</A>
</H2>


<P>For the LOWCODE segment, it is guaranteed that it won't be banked out, so it
is reachable at any time by interrupt handlers or similar.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3</A> <A HREF="#toc6.3">STARTUP</A>
</H2>


<P>This segment contains the startup code which initializes the C software stack
and the libraries. It is placed in its own segment because it needs to be
loaded at the lowest possible program address on several platforms.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4</A> <A HREF="#toc6.4">ZPSAVE</A>
</H2>


<P>The ZPSAVE segment contains the original values of the zeropage locations used
by the ZEROPAGE segment. It is placed in its own segment because it must not be
initialized.</P>
