This was meant as a trial, how to display rotating stripes on the screen. 
The method is explained in the file isoline.c
This program should compile for all platforms with conio library, but colors may change.
It was last compiled with the cc65 Version 2.11.0

Use "cl65 -l -Oirs isoline.c" to compile the program.

This is Version 0.6 and may be the last one.

To generate the sintable needed for the rotation i used
"Wixbouncer V1.1/Style" (http://style64.org).

The difference to version 0.5 is, that i used signed chars instead of 
signed ints wherever possible and that i shortened the sintable by 24 bytes.
To calculate the size of it i can not use sizeof(sinus)/sizeof(int)/2 anymore,
because the sinus is only 1.25 times in memory.
So i indroduced a constant specifying the size of the unrepeated sinus.
