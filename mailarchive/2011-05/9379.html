<a name="start" accesskey="j" id="start"></a>Hi,

I didn't receive any feedback at all on my posting below. So I'm
wondering by now if there was anything fundamentally wrong with it.
Maybe...

- to long to be read at all ?
- to offending to be anything but ignored ?
- to complicated to be understood ?
- to boring to be thought about ?
- to &lt;whatever&gt; ?

I've put quite some thoughts and effort into the TGI color topic so
I'm really interested to learn if there's something wrong about it !

Thanks in advance,
Oliver

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; If you're maintaining a cc65 TGI driver please read on...
&gt;
&gt; Quite some months ago we were discussing here improvements for the TGI
&gt; color handling. We reached some good results - however most of them
&gt; were not actually implemented. Therefore I revisited the topic.
&gt;
&gt; First let me briefly summarize our results:
&gt;
&gt; 1. We aggreed on that there is no benefit in using the same color
&gt; macros (i.e. COLOR_RED) for both conio and TGI. On the other hand
&gt; there might be targets that benefit from having different color values
&gt; for conio and TGI. Therefore we aggreed to introduce additional color
&gt; macros for TGI (i.e. TGI_COLOR_RED). The documentation is already
&gt; adjusted but there no TGI_COLOR_... macros whatsoever in the target
&gt; header files!
&gt;
&gt; 2. We aggreed that we live with the somewhat inconsistent usage of the
&gt; TGI_COLOR_... macros in the TGI API. As long as one doesn't modify the
&gt; default palette the macros can be used in the calls
&gt; tgi_setcolor/tgi_getcolor/tgi_getpixel just as expected. When is comes
&gt; however to palette manipulation the macros rather mean the palette
&gt; index of the color in question. For example after a tgi_getpalette one
&gt; can replace red with a different color with
&gt; mypalette[TGI_COLOR_RED]=... This means that the values of the macros
&gt; _MUST_ be in the range of 0..tgi_getmaxcolor. And this especially
&gt; means that the values for monochrome graphics must be 0 and 1 as those
&gt; have two palette entries.
&gt;
&gt; 3. We aggreed that the TGI_COLOR_... macros are defined in the target
&gt; header files thus allowing the targets to define them differently
&gt; (just like the COLOR_... macros for conio). However _ALL_ TGI drivers
&gt; for a single target need to share the TGI_COLOR... macros. This
&gt; requirement might very well mean that TGI drivers are required to
&gt; convert color values at runtime. Here's a hypothetical example:
&gt;
&gt; A certain target has two TGI drivers. One for a monochrome mode and
&gt; one for a 16-color mode. Because of the usage of the TGI_COLOR_...
&gt; macros as palette indices it is obligaroty to have
&gt; #define TGI_COLOR_BLACK 0
&gt; #define TGI_COLOR_WHITE 1
&gt; for the monochrome mode (see 2. above). But the 16-color mode needs
&gt; white to have the value $0F. Then the 16-color mode TGI driver needs
&gt; to convert (remap) the color values in order to allow TGI_COLOR_WHITE
&gt; to be used. This conversion is not only necessary for
&gt; tgi_setcolor/tgi_getcolor/tgi_getpixel but _ALSO_ for
&gt; tgi_setpalette/tgi_getpalette/tgi_getdefpalette where the second index
&gt; needs to be the one that shows as white in the default palette.
&gt;
&gt; 4. According to my records/memory we didn't discuss the actual palette
&gt; values. However the overall goal of cc65 TGI is to allow for
&gt; target-independent graphics programming and from that perspective i is
&gt; obligatory that the TGI_COLOR_... macros can be used as palette values
&gt; too. This means that a TGI_COLOR_... macro can serve three (!)
&gt; purposes:
&gt; - A &quot;simple&quot; color for tgi_setcolor/tgi_getcolor/tgi_getpixel
&gt; - A palette index corresponding to that color in the default palette
&gt; - A palette value
&gt;
&gt; Only if we follow these rules one can write things like:
&gt; mypalette = {TGI_COLOR_RED, TGI_COLOR_BLUE};
&gt; mypalette[TGI_COLOR_WHITE] = TGI_COLOR_GREEN;
&gt;
&gt; One implication of the these rules is btw. that _ALL_ default palettes
&gt; consist the ascending values in the range of 0..tgi_getmaxcolor.
&gt;
&gt; So far so good - I've been looking through the cc65 source code in
&gt; order to see what needs to be done to actually realize the above:
&gt;
&gt; - All targets without any TGI drivers don't need any TGI_COLOR_...
&gt; macros - a no-brainer.
&gt;
&gt; - 'c64' has only a monochrome mode driver. So the (black/white = 0/1)
&gt; rules above apply. It has a palette so additional color macros are
&gt; useful. As far as I understand the values are identical to the conio
&gt; values so I defined the TGI_COLOR_... macros to be identical to the
&gt; TGI_COLOR_... macros. Please speak up if this is wrong and needs to be
&gt; changed!
&gt;
&gt; - 'c128' has only monochrome mode drivers. So the (black/white = 0/1)
&gt; rules above apply. They have palettes so additional color macros are
&gt; useful. As far as I understand the values are identical to the conio
&gt; values so I defined the TGI_COLOR_... macros to be identical to the
&gt; TGI_COLOR_... macros. Please speak up if this is wrong and needs to be
&gt; changed! However the default palette contains as second value $0F (not
&gt; 1) so there is some work in the drivers necessary - which I can't do.
&gt;
&gt; - 'lynx' has only a 16-color mode driver. So the (black/white = 0/1)
&gt; rules do _NOT_ above apply. In fact white has the value $0F so this
&gt; target benefits from the target-specific TGI_COLOR_... macros. I
&gt; defined the 16 macros to be identical to the TGI_COLOR_... macros.
&gt; Please speak up if this is wrong and needs to be changed! However the
&gt; default palette has totally different values than the TGI_COLOR_...
&gt; macros - they even seem to be 16-bit values so there is some work in
&gt; the drivers necessary - which I can't do.
&gt;
&gt; - 'atmos' has only a monochrome mode driver. So the (black/white =
&gt; 0/1) rules above apply. It has a palette so addional color macros are
&gt; useful. However currently white has the value 7 (not 1). So here a
&gt; runtime conversion/mapping is necessary - which I can't do.
&gt;
&gt; - 'atari' has 5 monochrome mode drivers. So the (black/white = 0/1)
&gt; rules above apply. Given the generic driver architecture I don't
&gt; understand it but I'm pretty sure that most TGI drivers do need
&gt; conversion/mapping. As there not only monochrome and 16-color drivers
&gt; but addionally 4-color and 9-color drivers the conversion/mapping has
&gt; to take those into account as well. The colors used by the 4-color
&gt; drivers have to be in the range 0..3 and the 9-color driver colors
&gt; have to be 0..8 - which I can't do.
&gt;
&gt; - 'apple2[enh]' has an 8-color and 16-color mode driver. So the
&gt; (black/white = 0/1) rules do _NOT_ above apply. However the 16-color
&gt; mode driver needs does need conversion/mapping to use the same color
&gt; values the 8-color driver uses. I'll take care of that.
&gt;
&gt; As Uz already pointed out today the TGI kernel needs the value of
&gt; TGI_COLOR_WHITE as it sets the current color to white on tgi_init().
&gt; Therefore every target has to provide the TGI kernel with that value.
&gt; Uz provided my with the concept of doing so and I'll take care of that
&gt; pretty soon.
&gt;

&gt; Oliver
