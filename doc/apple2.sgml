<sect>Overview<p>

This file contains an overview of the Apple&nbsp;&rsqb;&lsqb; runtime system
as it comes with the cc65 C compiler. It describes the memory layout,
Apple&nbsp;&rsqb;&lsqb; specific header files, available drivers, and any
pitfalls specific to that platform.

Please note that Apple&nbsp;&rsqb;&lsqb; specific functions are just mentioned
here, they are described in detail in the separate <url url="funcref.html"
name="function reference">. Even functions marked as "platform dependent" may
be available on more than one platform. Please see the function reference for
more information.



<sect>Binary format<p>

The standard binary file format generated by the linker for the
Apple&nbsp;&rsqb;&lsqb; target is a binary program with a 4 byte DOS 3.3 header
containing the load address and load length. The default load address is
&dollar;803.

<bf/AppleCommander 1.3.5/ or later (available at <url
url="http://applecommander.sourceforge.net/">) includes the option <tt/-cc65/
that allows to put binary files with a DOS 3.3 header onto disk images
containing DOS 3.3 as well as ProDOS 8.

For ProDOS 8 system programs the load address is fixed to &dollar;2000 so there
is no need for a header. Thus the linker configuration
<ref id="apple-sys-cfg" name="apple2-system.cfg"> for those programs
omits the DOS 3.3 header. The right AppleCommander option to put system files
without a header on a ProDOS 8 disk image is <tt/-p/.


<sect>Memory layout<p>

In the standard setup, cc65 generated programs use the memory from
&dollar;803 to &dollar;95FF, so 35.5 KB of RAM are available.

Special locations:

<descrip>

  <tag/Stack/
  The C runtime stack is located at HIMEM and grows downwards, regardless of
  how your linker config file is setup.

  <tag/Heap/
  The C heap is located at the end of the program and grows towards the C
  runtime stack.

</descrip><p>

While running <tt/main()/ the Language Card bank 2 is enabled for read access.
However while running module constructors/destructors the Language Card is disabled.

Enabling the Language Card allows to use it as additional memory for cc65
generated code. However code is never automatically placed there. Rather code
needs to be explicitly placed in the Language Card either per file by compiling
with <tt/--code-name HIGHCODE/ or per function by enclosing in <tt/#pragma
code-name (push, "HIGHCODE")/ and <tt/#pragma code-name (pop)/. In either case the
cc65 runtime system takes care of actually moving the code into the Language
Card.

The amount of memory available in the Language Card for generated code depends
on the chosen <ref id="link-configs" name="linker configuration">.



<sect>Linker configurations<label id="link-configs"><p>

The ld65 linker comes with a default config file for the Apple&nbsp;&rsqb;&lsqb;,
which is used via <tt/-t apple2/.
The apple2 package comes with additional secondary linker config files, which
are used via <tt/-t apple2 -C &lt;configfile&gt;/.


<sect1>default config file (<tt/apple2.cfg/)<p>

Default configuration optimized for a binary program running on ProDOS 8 with
BASIC.SYSTEM. A plain vanilla ProDOS 8 doesn't actually use the Language Card
bank 2 memory from &dollar;D400 to &dollar;DFFF.

<descrip>

  <tag><tt/RAM:/ Main memory area</tag>
  From &dollar;803 to &dollar;95FF (35.5 KB)

  <tag><tt/HEADER:/ Binary file header</tag>
  None

</descrip><p>


<sect1><tt/apple2-loader.cfg/<label id="apple-load-cfg"><p>

Configuration optimized for a binary program running on ProDOS 8 without
BASIC.SYSTEM. Intended to be used with <bf/LOADER.SYSTEM - an
Apple&nbsp;&rsqb;&lsqb; ProDOS 8 loader for cc65 programs/, which is available
in the cc65 User Contributions section.

A program loaded by LOADER.SYSTEM works like a ProDOS 8 system program but
isn't tied to the start address &dollar;2000. Thus with the default start
address &dollar;800 the main memory area is increased by 6 KB.

<descrip>

  <tag><tt/RAM:/ Main memory area</tag>
  From &dollar;800 to &dollar;BEFF (45.75 KB)

  <tag><tt/LC:/ Language Card memory area</tag>
  From &dollar;D400 to &dollar;DFFF (3 KB)

  <tag><tt/STARTADDRESS:/ Program start address</tag>
  Variable (default: &dollar;800)

  <tag><tt/HEADER:/ Binary file header</tag>
  DOS 3.3 header (address and length)

</descrip><p>


<sect1><tt/apple2-reboot.cfg/<p>

Configuration optimized for a binary program running on ProDOS 8 without
BASIC.SYSTEM. Intended to be used with <bf/LOADER.SYSTEM - an
Apple&nbsp;&rsqb;&lsqb; ProDOS 8 loader for cc65 programs/ (see above) together
with the function <tt/rebootafterexit()/.

If a ProDOS 8 system program doesn't quit to the ProDOS 8 dispatcher but rather
reboots the machine after exit then a plain vanilla ProDOS 8 doesn't make use of
the Language Card bank 2 at all.

This setup makes nearly 50 KB available to a cc65 program - on a 64 KB machine!

  Variable (default: &dollar;800)

  <tag><tt/HEADER:/ Binary file header</tag>

</descrip><p>



<sect>ProDOS 8 system programs<p>

ProDOS 8 system programs are always loaded to the start address &dollar;2000.
For cc65 programs this means that the 6 KB from &dollar;800 to &dollar;2000 are
by default unused. There are however several options to make use of that memory
range.


<sect1>LOADER.SYSTEM<p>

The easiest (and for really large programs in fact the only) way to have a cc65
program use the memory from &dollar;800 to &dollar;2000 is to link it as binary
(as opposed to system) program using the linker configuration
<ref id="apple-load-cfg" name="apple2-loader.cfg"> with start address
&dollar;803 and load it with the targetutil LOADER.SYSTEM. The program then works
like a system program (i.e. quits to the ProDOS dispatcher).

Using LOADER.SYSTEM is as simple as copying it to the ProDOS 8 directory of the
program to load under name &lt;program&gt;.SYSTEM as a system program. For
example the program <tt/MYPROG/ is loaded by <tt/MYPROG.SYSTEM/.


<sect1>Heap<p>

If the cc65 program can be successfully linked as system program using the linker
configuration <ref id="apple-sys-cfg" name="apple2-system.cfg">, but
uses the heap either explicitly or implicitly (i.e. by loading a driver) then
the memory from &dollar;800 to &dollar;2000 can be added to the heap by calling
<tt/_heapadd ((void *) 0x0800, 0x1800);/ at the beginning of <tt/main()/.


<sect1>ProDOS 8 I/O buffers<p>

ProDOS 8 requires for every open file a page-aligned 1 KB I/O buffer. By default
these buffers are allocated by the cc65 runtime system on the heap using
<tt/posix_memalign()/. While this is generally the best solution it means quite
some overhead for (especially rather small) cc65 programs which do open files
but don't make use of the heap otherwise.

The apple2 package comes with the alternative ProDOS 8 I/O buffer allocation
module <tt/apple2-iobuf-0800.o/ which uses the memory between &dollar;800 and
the program start address for the 1 KB I/O buffers. For system programs (with
start address &dollar;2000) this results in up to 6 I/O buffers and thus up to 6
concurrently open files.

While using <tt/_heapadd()/ as described in the section above together with the
default I/O buffer allocation basically yields the same placement of I/O buffers
in memory the primary benefit of <tt/apple2-iobuf-0800.o/ is a reduction in code
size - and thus program file size - of more than 1400 bytes.

Using <tt/apple2-iobuf-0800.o/ is as simple as placing it on the linker command
line like this:

<tscreen><verb>
cl65 -t apple2 -C apple2-system.cfg myprog.c apple2-iobuf-0800.o
</verb></tscreen>



<sect>Platform specific header files<p>

Programs containing Apple&nbsp;&rsqb;&lsqb; specific code may use the
<tt/apple2.h/ header file.


<sect1>Apple&nbsp;&rsqb;&lsqb; specific functions<p>

The functions listed below are special for the Apple&nbsp;&rsqb;&lsqb;. See
the <url url="funcref.html" name="function reference"> for declaration and
usage.

<itemize>
<item>_auxtype
<item>_dos_type
<item>_filetype
<item>get_ostype
<item>rebootafterexit
<item>ser_apple2_slot
<item>tgi_apple2_mix
</itemize>


<sect1>Hardware access<p>

There's currently no support for direct hardware access. This does not mean
you cannot do it, it just means that there's no help.



<sect>Loadable drivers<p>

The names in the parentheses denote the symbols to be used for static linking of the drivers.


<sect1>Graphics drivers<p>

<descrip>

  <tag><tt/a2.lo.tgi (a2_lo_tgi)/</tag>
  This driver features a resolution of 40&times;48 with 16 colors.

  The function <tt/tgi_apple2_mix()/ allows to activate 4 lines of text. The
  function clears the corresponding area at the bottom of the screen.

  <tag><tt/a2.hi.tgi (a2_hi_tgi)/</tag>
  This driver features a resolution of 280&times;192 with 8 colors and two
  hires pages. Note that programs using this driver will have to be linked
  with <tt/--start-addr $4000/ to reserve the first hires page or with
  <tt/--start-addr $6000/ to reserve both hires pages.

  The function <tt/tgi_apple2_mix()/ allows to activate 4 lines of text. The
  function doesn't clear the corresponding area at the bottom of the screen.

  In memory constrained situations the memory from &dollar;803 to &dollar;1FFF
  can be made available to a program by calling <tt/_heapadd ((void *) 0x0803, 0x17FD);/
  at the beginning of <tt/main()/. Doing so is beneficial even if the program
  doesn't use the the heap explicitly because loading the driver (and in fact
  already opening the driver file) uses the heap implicitly.

</descrip><p>


<sect1>Extended memory drivers<p>

<descrip>

  <tag><tt/a2.auxmem.emd (a2_auxmem_emd)/</tag>
  Gives access to 47.5 KB RAM (190 pages of 256 bytes each) on an Extended
  80-Column Text Card.

  Note that this driver doesn't check for the actual existence of the memory
  and that it doesn't check for ProDOS 8 RAM disk content!

</descrip><p>


<sect1>Joystick drivers<p>

<descrip>

  <tag><tt/a2.stdjoy.joy (a2_stdjoy_joy)/</tag>
  Supports up to two standard analog joysticks connected to the game port of
  the Apple&nbsp;&rsqb;&lsqb;.

</descrip><p>


<sect1>Mouse drivers<p>

<descrip>

  <tag><tt/a2.stdmou.mou (a2_stdmou_mou)/</tag>
  Driver for the AppleMouse&nbsp;II Card. Searches all Apple&nbsp;II slots
  for an AppleMouse&nbsp;II Card compatible firmware. The default bounding
  box is &lsqb;0..279,0..191&rsqb;.

  Programs using this driver will have to be linked with <tt/--start-addr $4000/
  to reserve the first hires page if they are intended to run on an
  Apple&nbsp;&rsqb;&lsqb; (in contrast to an Apple&nbsp;//e) because the
  AppleMouse&nbsp;II Card firmware writes to the hires page when initializing
  on that machine.

  Note that the Apple&nbsp;&rsqb;&lsqb; default mouse callbacks support text
  mode only.

</descrip><p>


<sect1>RS232 device drivers<p>

<descrip>

  <tag><tt/a2.ssc.ser (a2_ssc_ser)/</tag>
  Driver for the Apple&nbsp;II Super Serial Card. Supports up to 19200 baud,
  hardware flow control (RTS/CTS) and interrupt driven receives. Note
  that because of the peculiarities of the 6551 chip transmits are not
  interrupt driven, and the transceiver blocks if the receiver asserts
  flow control because of a full buffer.

  The driver defaults to slot 2. Call <tt/ser_apple2_slot()/ prior to
  <tt/ser_open()/ in order to select a different slot. <tt/ser_apple2_slot()/
  succeeds for all Apple&nbsp;II slots, but <tt/ser_open()/ fails with
  <tt/SER_ERR_NO_DEVICE/ if there's no SSC firmware found in the selected slot.

</descrip><p>



<sect>Limitations<p>


<sect1>DOS 3.3<p>

Although the standard binaries generated by the linker for the Apple&nbsp;&rsqb;&lsqb;
generally run both on DOS 3.3 (with Applesoft BASIC) and on ProDOS 8 (with
BASIC.SYSTEM) there are some limitations for DOS 3.3:

<descrip>

  <tag>Disk File I/O</tag>
  There's no disk file I/O support. Any attempt to use it yields an error with
  <tt/errno/ set to <tt/ENOSYS/. This implicitly means that loadable drivers
  are in general not functional as they depend on disk file I/O. Therefore the statically
  linked drivers have to be used instead.

  <tag/Interrupts/
  There's no <tt/interruptor/ support. Any attempt to use it yields the message
  'FAILED TO ALLOC INTERRUPT' on program startup. This implicitly means that
  <tt/a2.stdmou.mou/ and <tt/a2.ssc.ser/ are not functional as they depend on
  interrupts.

</descrip><p>


<sect1>Direct console I/O<p>

<descrip>

  <tag/Color/
  The Apple&nbsp;&rsqb;&lsqb; has no color text mode. Therefore the functions textcolor(),
  bgcolor() and bordercolor() have no effect.

  <tag/Cursor/
  The Apple&nbsp;&rsqb;&lsqb; has no hardware cursor. Therefore the function cursor() has
  no effect.

</descrip><p>



<sect>Other hints<p>


<sect1>Passing arguments to the program<p>

Command line arguments can be passed to <tt/main()/ after BLOAD. Since this is not
supported by BASIC, the following syntax was chosen:

<tscreen><verb>
]CALL2051:REM ARG1 " ARG2 IS QUOTED" ARG3 "" ARG5
</verb></tscreen>

<enum>
<item>Arguments are separated by spaces.
<item>Arguments may be quoted.
<item>Leading and trailing spaces around an argument are ignored. Spaces within
      a quoted argument are allowed.
<item>The first argument passed to <tt/main/ is the program name.
<item>A maximum number of 10 arguments (including the program name) are
      supported.
</enum>


<sect1>Interrupts<p>

The runtime for the Apple&nbsp;&rsqb;&lsqb; uses routines marked as
<tt/.INTERRUPTOR/ for ProDOS 8 interrupt handlers. Such routines must be
written as simple machine language subroutines and will be called
automatically by the interrupt handler code when they are linked into a
program. See the discussion of the <tt/.CONDES/ feature in the <url
url="ca65.html" name="assembler manual">.


<sect1>DIO<p>

<descrip>

  <tag/Drive ID/
  The function <url url="dio.html#s1" name="dio_open()"> has the single
  parameter <tt/device/ to identify the device to be opened. Therefore an
  Apple&nbsp;II slot and drive pair is mapped to that <tt/device/ according
  to the formula

  <tscreen>
    device = slot + (drive - 1) * 8
  </tscreen>

  so that for example slot 6 drive 2 is mapped to <tt/device/ 14.

  <tag/Sector count/
  The function <url url="dio.html#s3" name="dio_query_sectcount()"> returns
  the correct sector count for all ProDOS 8 disks. However for any non-ProDOS 8
  disk it simply always returns 280 (which is only correct for a 140 KB disk).
  This condition is indicated by the <tt/_oserror/ value 82.
