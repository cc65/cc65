<P>This is a short intro of how to use the compiler and the bin-utils. It contains
a step-by-step example of how to build a complete application from one C and
one assembly modules. This file does <EM>not</EM> contain a complete reference for
the tools used in the process. There are separate files describing those tools,
in detail (see 
<A HREF="index.html">index.html</A>).</P>
<P>I do assume that you have downloaded and installed the compiler and
target-specific files. Windows users should use the friendly .exe installer
(named cc65-2.13.0-1.exe for version 2.13.0 of the package - adjust the
version number if necessary). It does not only install the target files, but
will also set up necessary environment variables for you.</P>
<P>If you're going for the .ZIP archives, please note that there is one file for
the host platform (Windows, DOS or OS/2), one file for each target platform
(C64 or whatever) and a separate file containing the docs (which include the
file you're currently reading). So for most uses, you will need at least 3
files and unpack all three into one directory. In case of the .ZIP archives,
you will also need to set the environment variables <CODE>CC65_INC</CODE>,
<CODE>LD65_LIB</CODE> and <CODE>LD65_CFG</CODE> as described below.</P>
<P><EM>Note:</EM> There is a much simpler way to compile this example, by using the
<B>cl65</B> compile-and-link utility. However, it makes sense to understand how
the separate steps work. How to do the example with the <B>cl65</B> utility is
described 
<A HREF="#using-cl65">later</A>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1</A> <A HREF="#toc1.1">Before we start</A>
</H2>


<P>You will find a copy of the sample modules, used in the next section, in the
"<CODE>cc65/samples/tutorial</CODE>" directory. If you encounter problems with
missing include files and/or libraries, please check the environment variables
<CODE>CC65_INC</CODE>, <CODE>LD65_LIB</CODE> and <CODE>LD65_CFG</CODE>. They should point to the
<CODE>include</CODE>, <CODE>lib</CODE> and <CODE>cfg</CODE> subdirectories of the directory, where you
installed cc65.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2</A> <A HREF="#toc1.2">The sample modules</A>

<P>To explain the development flow, I will use the following example modules:</P>

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P><CODE>crt0.o</CODE> (the startup code) and <CODE>c64.lib</CODE> (the C64 version of the runtime
and C library) are provided in binary form in the cc65 package. Actually, the
startup code is contained in the library, so you won't need to care about it.</P>



<H2><A NAME="s2">2.</A> <A HREF="#toc2">The compiler</A></H2>


<P>The compiler translates one C source into one assembly source, for each
invocation. It does <EM>not</EM> create object files directly, and it is <EM>not</EM>
able to translate more than one file per run.</P>
<P>In the example above, we would use the following command line, to translate
<CODE>hello.c</CODE> into <CODE>hello.s</CODE>:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        cc65 -O -t c64 hello.c
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The <CODE>-O</CODE> switch tells the compiler to do an additional optimizer run, which
is usually a good idea, since it makes the code smaller. If you don't care
about the size, but want to have slightly faster code, use <CODE>-Oi</CODE> to inline
some runtime functions.</P>
<P>The <CODE>-t</CODE> switch is followed by the target system name.</P>
<P>If the compiler does not complain about errors in our "hello world" program, we
will have a file named "<CODE>hello.s</CODE>", in our directory, that contains the
assembly source for the <B>hello</B> module.</P>
<P>For more information about the compiler, see 
<A HREF="cc65.html">cc65.html</A>.</P>



<H2><A NAME="s3">3.</A> <A HREF="#toc3">The assembler</A></H2>


<P>The assembler translates one assembly source into an object file, for each
invocation. The assembler is <EM>not</EM> able to translate more than one source
file per run.</P>
<P>Let's translate the "hello.s" and "text.s" files from our example:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        ca65 hello.s
        ca65 -t c64 text.s
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The <CODE>-t</CODE> switch is needed when translating the <CODE>text.s</CODE> file, so the
text is converted from the input character-set (usually ISO-8859-1) into the
target character-set (PETSCII, in this example) by the assembler. The
compiler-generated file <CODE>hello.s</CODE> does not contain any character constants,
so specification of a target is not necessary (it wouldn't do any harm,
however).</P>
<P>If the assembler does not complain, we should now have two object files (named
<CODE>hello.o</CODE> and <CODE>text.o</CODE>) in the current directory.</P>
<P>For more information about the assembler, see 
<A HREF="ca65.html">ca65.html</A>.</P>



<H2><A NAME="s4">4.</A> <A HREF="#toc4">The linker</A></H2>


<P>The linker combines several object and library files into one output file.
<B>ld65</B> is very configurable, but fortunately has built-in configurations,
so we don't need to mess with configuration files, here.</P>
<P>The compiler uses small functions to do things that cannot be done inline
without a big impact on code size. Those runtime functions, together with the
C library, are in an object-file archive named after the system, in this case,
"<CODE>c64.lib</CODE>". We have to specify that file on the command line, so that the
linker can resolve those functions.</P>
<P>Let's link our files to get the final executable:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        ld65 -o hello -t c64 hello.o text.o c64.lib
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The argument after <CODE>-o</CODE> specifies the name of the output file, the argument
after <CODE>-t</CODE> gives the target system. The following arguments are object
files or libraries. Since the target library resolves imports in <CODE>hello.o</CODE>
and <CODE>text.o</CODE>, it must be specified <EM>after</EM> those files.</P>
<P>After a successful linker run, we have a file named "<CODE>hello</CODE>", ready for
our C64!</P>
<P>For more information about the linker, see 
<A HREF="ld65.html">ld65.html</A>.</P>



<H2><A NAME="using-cl65"></A> <A NAME="s5">5.</A> <A HREF="#toc5">The easy way (using the cl65 utility)</A></H2>


<P>The <B>cl65</B> utility is able to do all of the steps described above, in just
one command line, and it has defaults for some options that are very
well-suited for our example.</P>
<P>To compile both files into one executable, enter:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        cl65 -O hello.c text.s
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The <B>cl65</B> utility knows how to translate C files into object files (it will
call the compiler, and then the assembler). It does know also how to create
object files from assembly files (it will call only the assembler, for that).
It knows how to build an executable (it will pass all object files to the
linker). And finally, it has the C64 as a default target, and will supply the
correct startup file and runtime library names to the linker, so you don't
have to care about that.</P>
<P>The one-liner above should give you a C64 executable named "<CODE>hello</CODE>" in the
current directory.</P>
<P>For more information about the compile &amp; link utility, see 
<A HREF="cl65.html">cl65.html</A>.</P>



<H2><A NAME="s6">6.</A> <A HREF="#toc6">Running The Executable</A></H2>


<P><EM>Note: this section is incomplete!</EM></P>
<P>Depending on the target, cc65 chooses several methods of making a program
available for execution. Here, we list sample emulators and instructions for
running the program. Unless noted, similar instructions would also apply to a
real machine. One word of advice: we suggest you clear the screen at the
start, and wait for a keypress at the end of your program, as each target
varies in its start and exit conditions.</P>

run automatically upon booting a DOS disk, sort of like the "autoexec.bat" of
the MSDOS/Windows world.  We've avoided that in the example, however.  Also,
the <CODE>B</CODE> parameter must be in caps., and "test" is the name of the program as
it will appear on the Apple disk.</P>
<P>Start the emulator, click on the <B>Disk 1</B> icon, and point to <B>cc65.dsk</B>;

<B>YES</B> if you did (or, click <B>NO</B> if you made a mistake).  After the
program has converted "<CODE>hello1</CODE>" from a CBM file into a GEOS file, it will
announce what it did -- click on <B>OK</B>.  <B>CONVERT</B> will show the file list
again.  This time, click on <B>Quit</B>.</P>
<P>(You might need to put the boot disk back into the drive, in order to reload
<B>deskTop</B>.  Then, you must swap back to the disk with the tutorial program
on it, and click on its disk icon [on the right side of the screen].)</P>
<P>Now, you must find <B>hello1</B>.  Click on the lower left-hand corner of the
directory notePad.  Look at the eight file-positions on each page until you see
<B>hello1</B>.  Double-click on its icon.</P>
<P>The output is shown in a GEOS dialog box; click <B>OK</B> when you have finished
reading it.</P>

<P>We need your help! Recommended emulators and instructions for other targets
are missing.  We suggest that you choose emulators with good compatibility.
Also, being able to run all computers in the target series is good for
target compatibility testing. A machine-language monitor is almost essential
for debugging, but a native debugger could be used, as well.</P>
<P>Finally, emulators which run on Unix or Windows would help to reach a wider
audience.</P>
