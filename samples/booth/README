An implementation of booth's algorithm for 8x8 multiplication written for ca65, and
a demonstration of how to call it using __fastcall__ conventions from C.

Compiled for 6502 (65C02 people could probably add a few fancy instructions).

To keep it simple, this uses the sim65 environment, but apart from some I/O in the
test application, it's almost all about CPU.

"sim65 boothtest compare" runs all possible combinations of signed 8x8 multiplication 
using the booth algorithm and compares it to the standard routines. 

"sim65 -c boothtest regular" and "sim65 -c boothtest booth" can be used as an elementary
comparison of performance. Yes, it's the cycle count for the whole program,
not for the booth multiply alone. But it gives some interesting results.
