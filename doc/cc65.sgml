<abstract>
cc65 is a C compiler for 6502 targets. It supports several 6502 based home
computers like the Commodore and Atari machines, but it is easily retargetable.

<sect>Overview<p>

cc65 was originally a C compiler for the Atari 8-bit machines written by
John R. Dunning. In prior releases I've described the compiler by listing
up the changes made by me. I have made many more changes in the meantime
(and rewritten major parts of the compiler), so I will no longer do that,
since the list would be too large and of no use to anyone. Instead I will
describe the compiler in respect to the ANSI/ISO C standard.

There are separate documents named <url url="library.html"> and <url
url="funcref.html"> that cover the library that is available for the compiler.
If you know C, and are interested in doing actual programming, the library
documentation is probably of much more use than this document.

If you need some hints for getting the best code out of the compiler, you
may have a look at <url url="coding.html"> which covers some code generation
issues.



<sect>Usage<p>

The compiler translates C files into files containing assembly code that
may be translated by the ca65 macroassembler (for more information about
the assembler, have a look at <url url="ca65.html">).


<sect1>Command line option overview<p>

The compiler may be called as follows:

<sect1>Command line options in detail<p>

Here is a description of all the command line options:

<descrip>

  <tag><tt>--all-cdecl</tt></tag>

  Tells the compiler that functions which aren't declared explicitly with
  either the <tt/__cdecl__/ or <tt/__fastcall__/ calling conventions should
  have the cdecl convention.  (Normally, functions that aren't variadic are
  fast-called.)


  <label id="option-bss-name">
  <tag><tt>--bss-name seg</tt></tag>

  Set the name of the bss segment. See also <tt/<ref id="pragma-bss-name"
  name="#pragma&nbsp;bss-name">/.


  <label id="option-check-stack">
  <tag><tt>--check-stack</tt></tag>

  Tells the compiler to generate code that checks for stack overflows. See
  <tt/<ref id="pragma-check-stack" name="#pragma&nbsp;check-stack">/ for an
  explanation of this feature.


  <label id="option-code-name">
  <tag><tt>--code-name seg</tt></tag>

  Set the name of the code segment. See also <tt/<ref id="pragma-code-name"
  name="#pragma&nbsp;code-name">/


  <label id="option-codesize">
  <tag><tt>--codesize x</tt></tag>

  This options allows finer control about speed vs. size decisions in the code
  generation and optimization phases. It gives the allowed size increase
  factor (in percent). The default is 100 when not using <tt/-Oi/ and 200 when
  using <tt/-Oi/ (<tt/-Oi/ is the same as <tt/-O --codesize&nbsp;200/).


  <label id="option--cpu">
  <tag><tt>--cpu CPU</tt></tag>

  Set the CPU, the compiler generates code for. You may specify "6502" or
  "65C02" as the CPU. The default depends on the selected target (see option
  <tt/<ref id="option-t" name="-t">/). It is the 6502 CPU for most targets or
  if no target has been set. Specifying 65C02 will use a few 65C02
  instructions when generating code. Don't expect too much from this option:
  In most cases the difference in size and speed is just 1-2%.


  <label id="option-create-dep">
  <tag><tt>--create-dep name</tt></tag>

  Tells the compiler to generate a file containing the dependency list for the
  compiled module in makefile syntax. The output is written to a file with the
  given name. The output does not include system include files (in angle
  brackets).


  <label id="option-create-full-dep">
  <tag><tt>--create-full-dep name</tt></tag>

  Tells the compiler to generate a file containing the dependency list for the
  compiled module in makefile syntax. The output is written to a file with the
  given name. The output does include system include files (in angle
  brackets).


  <label id="option-data-name">
  <tag><tt>--data-name seg</tt></tag>

  Set the name of the data segment. See also <tt/<ref id="pragma-data-name"
  name="#pragma&nbsp;data-name">/


  <tag><tt>-d, --debug</tt></tag>

  Enables debug mode, something that should not be needed for mere
  mortals:-)


  <label id="option-dep-target">
  <tag><tt>--dep-target target</tt></tag>

  When generating a dependency file, don't use the actual output file as the
  target of the dependency, but the file specified with this option. The
  option has no effect if neither <tt/<ref id="option-create-dep"
  name="--create-dep">/ nor <tt/<ref id="option-create-full-dep"
  name="--create-full-dep">/ is specified.


  <tag><tt>-D sym[=definition]</tt></tag>

  Define a macro on the command line. If no definition is given, the macro
  is defined to the value "1".


  <tag><tt>-g, --debug-info</tt></tag>

  This will cause the compiler to insert a <tt/.DEBUGINFO/ command into the
  generated assembler code. This will cause the assembler to include all
  symbols in a special section in the object file.


  <tag><tt>-h, --help</tt></tag>

  Print the short option summary shown above.


  <label id="option-list-warnings">
  <tag><tt>--list-warnings</tt></tag>

  List the names of warning types available for use with <tt><ref
  id="option-W" name="-W"></tt>.


  <label id="option-local-strings">
  <tag><tt>--local-strings</tt></tag>

  Emit string literals into the rodata segment as soon as they're encountered
  in the source (even if you do nothing but get the sizeof those strings). The
  default is to keep string literals until end of assembly, merge read only
  literals if possible, and then output the literals into the data or rodata
  segment that is active at that point. Use of this option prevents merging of
  duplicate strings, but the options that change the name of one of the data
  segments will work.

  You can also use <tt><ref id="pragma-local-strings"
  name="#pragma&nbsp;local-strings"></tt> for fine grained control.


  <tag><tt>-o name</tt></tag>

  Specify the name of the output file. If you don't specify a name, the
  name of the C input file is used, with the extension replaced by ".s".


  <label id="option-register-vars">
  <tag><tt>-r, --register-vars</tt></tag>

  <tt/-r/ will make the compiler honor the <tt/register/ keyword. Local
  variables may be placed in registers (which are actually zero page
  locations). There is some overhead involved with register variables, since
  the old contents of the registers must be saved and restored. Since register
  variables are of limited use without the optimizer, there is also a combined
  switch: <tt/-Or/ will enable both, the optimizer and register variables.

  For more information about register variables see <ref id="register-vars"
  name="register variables">.

  The compiler setting can also be changed within the source file by using
  <tt/<ref id="pragma-register-vars" name="#pragma&nbsp;register-vars">/.


  <label id="option-register-space">
  <tag><tt>--register-space</tt></tag>

  This option takes a numeric parameter and is used to specify, how much
  zero page register space is available. Please note that just giving this
  option will not increase or decrease by itself, it will just tell the
  compiler about the available space. You will have to allocate that space
  yourself using an assembler module with the necessary allocations, and a
  linker configuration that matches the assembler module. The default value
  for this option is 6 (bytes).

  If you don't know what all this means, please don't use this option.


  <label id="option-rodata-name">
  <tag><tt>--rodata-name seg</tt></tag>

  Set the name of the rodata segment (the segment used for readonly data).
  See also <tt/<ref id="pragma-rodata-name" name="#pragma&nbsp;rodata-name">/

  <label id="option-signed-chars">
  <tag><tt>-j, --signed-chars</tt></tag>

  Using this option, you can make the default characters signed. Since the
  6502 has no provisions for sign extending characters (which is needed on
  almost any load operation), this will make the code larger and slower. A
  better way is to declare characters explicitly as "signed" if needed. You
  can also use <tt><ref id="pragma-signed-chars"
  name="#pragma&nbsp;signed-chars"></tt> for better control of this option.


  <label id="option--standard">
  <tag><tt>--standard std</tt></tag>

  This option allows to set the language standard supported. The argument is
  one of
  <descrip>
    <tag/c89/
      This disables anything that is illegal in C89/C90. Among those things
      are <tt>//</tt> comments and the non-standard keywords without
      underscores. Please note that cc65 is not a fully C89 compliant compiler
      despite this option. A few more things (like floats) are missing.

    <tag/c99/
      This enables a few features from the C99 standard. With this option,
      <tt>//</tt> comments are allowed. It will also cause warnings and even
      errors in a few situations that are allowed with <tt/--standard c89/.
      For example, a call to a function without a prototype is an error in
      this mode.

    <tag/cc65/
      This is the default mode. It is like c99 mode, but additional features
      are enabled. Among these are "void data", non-standard keywords without
      the underlines, unnamed function parameters and the requirement for
      main() to return an int.
  </descrip>

  Please note that the compiler does not support the C99 standard and never
  will. c99 mode is actually c89 mode with a few selected C99 extensions.


  <label id="option-t">
  <tag><tt>-t target, --target target</tt></tag>

  This option is used to set the target system. The target system determines
  the character set that is used for strings and character constants and the
  default CPU. The CPU setting can be overriden by use of the <tt/<ref
  id="option--cpu" name="--cpu">/ option.

  The following target systems are supported:

  <itemize>
  <item>none
  <item>apple2
  <item>apple2enh
  <item>atari
  <item>atarixl
  <item>atmos
  <item>c16 (works also for the c116 with memory up to 32K)
  <item>c64
  <item>c128
  <item>cbm510 (CBM-II series with 40 column video)
  <item>cbm610 (all CBM-II II computers with 80 column video)
  <item>geos-apple
  <item>geos-cbm
  <item>lunix
  <item>lynx
  <item>nes
  <item>osic1p
  <item>pet (all CBM PET systems except the 2001)
  <item>plus4
  <item>sim6502
  <item>sim65c02
  <item>supervision
  <item>vic20
  </itemize>

  <tag><tt>-v, --verbose</tt></tag>

  Using this option, the compiler will be somewhat more verbose if errors
  or warnings are encountered.


  <label id="option-writable-strings">
  <tag><tt>--writable-strings</tt></tag>

  Make string literals writable by placing them into the data segment instead
  of the rodata segment. You can also use <tt><ref id="pragma-writable-strings"
  name="#pragma&nbsp;writable-strings"></tt> to control this option from within
  the source file.


  <label id="option-static-locals">
  <tag><tt>-Cl, --static-locals</tt></tag>

  Use static storage for local variables instead of storage on the stack.
  Since the stack is emulated in software, this gives shorter and usually
  faster code, but the code is no longer reentrant. The difference between
  <tt/-Cl/ and declaring local variables as static yourself is, that
  initializer code is executed each time, the function is entered. So when
  using

  <tscreen><verb>
   	void f (void)
   	{
   	    unsigned a = 1;
   	    ...
   	}
  </verb></tscreen>

  the variable <tt/a/ will always have the value <tt/1/ when entering the
  function and using <tt/-Cl/, while in

  <tscreen><verb>
   	void f (void)
   	{
   	    static unsigned a = 1;
   	    ....
   	}
  </verb></tscreen>

  the variable <tt/a/ will have the value <tt/1/ only the first time that the
  function is entered, and will keep the old value from one call of the
  function to the next.

  You may also use <tt><ref id="pragma-static-locals"
  name="#pragma&nbsp;static-locals"></tt> to change this setting in your
  sources.


  <label id="option-include-dir">
  <tag><tt>-I dir, --include-dir dir</tt></tag>

  Set a directory where the compiler searches for include files. You may
  use this option multiple times to add more than one directory to the
  search list.


  <label id="option-O">
  <tag><tt>-O, -Oi, -Or, -Os</tt></tag>

  Enable an optimizer run over the produced code.

  Using <tt/-Oi/, the code generator will inline some code where otherwise a
  runtime functions would have been called, even if the generated code is
  larger. This will not only remove the overhead for a function call, but will
  make the code visible for the optimizer. <tt/-Oi/ is an alias for
  <tt/-O --codesize&nbsp;200/.

  <tt/-Or/ will make the compiler honor the <tt/register/ keyword. Local
  variables may be placed in registers (which are actually zero page
  locations). See also the <tt/<ref id="option-register-vars"
  name="--register-vars">/ command line option, and the <ref
  id="register-vars" name="discussion of register variables"> below.

  Using <tt/-Os/ will force the compiler to inline some known functions from
  the C library like strlen. Note: This has two consequences:
  <p>
  <itemize>
  <item>You may not use names of standard C functions in your own code. If you
     	do that, your program is not standard compliant anyway, but using
     	<tt/-Os/ will actually break things.
     	<p>
  <item>The inlined string and memory functions will not handle strings or
	memory areas larger than 255 bytes. Similarly, the inlined <tt/is..()/
	functions will not work with values outside the char. range (such as
	<tt/EOF/).
     	<p>
  </itemize>
  <p>
  It is possible to concatenate the modifiers for <tt/-O/. For example, to
  enable register variables and inlining of known functions, you may use
  <tt/-Ors/.


  <tag><tt>-T, --add-source</tt></tag>

  This include the source code as comments in the generated code. This is
  normally not needed.


  <tag><tt>-V, --version</tt></tag>

  Print the version number of the compiler. When submitting a bug report,
  please include the operating system you're using, and the compiler
  version.


  <label id="option-W">
  <tag><tt>-W name[,name]</tt></tag>

  This option allows to control warnings generated by the compiler. It is
  followed by a comma separated list of warnings that should be enabled or
  disabled. To disable a warning, its name is prefixed by a minus sign. If
  no such prefix exists, or the name is prefixed by a plus sign, the warning
  is enabled.

  The following warning names are currently recognized:
  <descrip>
  <tag><tt/const-comparison/</tag>
        Warn if the result of a comparison is constant.
  <tag><tt/error/</tag>
        Treat all warnings as errors.
  <tag><tt/no-effect/</tag>
        Warn about statements that don't have an effect.
  <tag><tt/struct-param/</tag>
        Warn when passing structs by value.
  <tag><tt/unknown-pragma/</tag>
        Warn about known #pragmas.
  <tag><tt/unused-label/</tag>
        Warn about unused labels.
  <tag><tt/unused-param/</tag>
        Warn about unused function parameters.
  <tag><tt/unused-var/</tag>
        Warn about unused variables.
  </descrip>

  The full list of available warning names may be retrieved by using the
  option <tt><ref id="option-list-warnings" name="--list-warnings"></tt>.

  You may also use <tt><ref id="pragma-warn" name="#pragma&nbsp;warn"></tt> to
  control this setting for smaller pieces of code from within your code.

</descrip><p>


<sect>Input and output<p>

The compiler will accept one C file per invocation and create a file with
the same base name, but with the extension replaced by ".s". The output
file contains assembler code suitable for use with the ca65 macro
assembler.

Include files in quotes are searched in the following places:
<enum>
<item>The current file's directory.
<item>Any directory added with the <tt/-I/ option on the command line.
<item>The value of the environment variable <tt/CC65_INC/ if it is defined.
</enum>

Include files in angle brackets are searched in the following places:
<enum>
<item>Any directory added with the <tt/-I/ option on the command line.
<item>The value of the environment variable <tt/CC65_INC/ if it is defined.
<item>A subdirectory named <tt/include/ of the directory defined in the
      environment variable <tt/CC65_HOME/, if it is defined.
<item>An optionally compiled-in directory.
</enum>



<sect>Differences to the ISO standard<p>

Apart from the things listed below, the compiler does support additional
keywords, has several functions in the standard headers with names outside the
reserved namespace and a few syntax extensions. All these can be disabled with
the <tt><ref id="option--standard" name="--standard"></tt> command line
option. Its use for maximum standards compatibility is advised.

Here is a list of differences between the language, the compiler accepts,
and the one defined by the ISO standard:

<itemize>

<item>	The datatypes "float" and "double" are not available.
      	<p>
<item> 	C Functions may not return structs (or unions), and structs may not
        be passed as parameters by value. However, struct assignment *is*
      	possible.
      	<p>
<item>	Most of the C library is available with only the fastcall calling
	convention (<ref id="extension-fastcall" name="see below">).  It means
	that you must not mix pointers to those functions with pointers to
	user-written, cdecl functions (the calling conventions are incompatible).
	<p>
<item>	The <tt/volatile/ keyword doesn't have an effect. This is not as bad
        as it sounds, since the 6502 has so few registers that it isn't
        possible to keep values in registers anyway.
	<p>
</itemize>

There may be some more minor differences I'm currently not aware of. The
biggest problem is the missing float data type. With this limitation in
mind, you should be able to write fairly portable code.



<sect>Extensions<p>

This cc65 version has some extensions to the ISO C standard.

<itemize>

<item>	The compiler allows to insert assembler statements into the output
     	file. The syntax is

	<tscreen><verb>
	asm (&lt;string literal&gt;[, optional parameters]) ;
     	</verb></tscreen>
     	or
	<tscreen><verb>
       	__asm__ (&lt;string literal&gt;[, optional parameters]) ;
     	</verb></tscreen>

     	The first form is in the user namespace and is disabled if the <tt/-A/
     	switch is given.

	There is a whole section covering inline assembler statements,
	<ref id="inline-asm" name="see there">.
	<p>

<label id="extension-fastcall">
<item>	The normal calling convention -- for non-variadic functions -- is
	named "fastcall". The syntax for a function declaration that
	<em/explicitly/ uses fastcall is

	<tscreen><verb>
	&lt;return type&gt; fastcall &lt;function name&gt; (&lt;parameter list&gt;)
     	</verb></tscreen>
     	or
	<tscreen><verb>
	&lt;return type&gt; __fastcall__ &lt;function name&gt; (&lt;parameter list&gt;)
     	</verb></tscreen>
	An example is
	<tscreen><verb>
	void __fastcall__ f (unsigned char c)
     	</verb></tscreen>
	The first form of the fastcall keyword is in the user namespace and can
	therefore be disabled with the <tt><ref id="option--standard"
        name="--standard"></tt> command line option.

	For functions that are <tt/fastcall/, the rightmost parameter is not
	pushed on the stack but left in the primary register when the function
	is called. That significantly reduces the cost of calling those functions.
	<newline><newline>
	<p>

<item>  There is another calling convention named "cdecl". Variadic functions
        (their prototypes have an ellipsis &lsqb;<tt/.../&rsqb;) always use that
        convention. The syntax for a function declaration using cdecl is

        <tscreen><verb>
        &lt;return type&gt; cdecl &lt;function name&gt; (&lt;parameter list&gt;)
        </verb></tscreen>
        or
        <tscreen><verb>
        &lt;return type&gt; __cdecl__ &lt;function name&gt; (&lt;parameter list&gt;)
        </verb></tscreen>
        An example is
        <tscreen><verb>
        int* __cdecl__ f (unsigned char c)
        </verb></tscreen>

        The first form of the cdecl keyword is in the user namespace;
        and therefore, can be disabled with the <tt/<ref id="option--standard"
        name="--standard">/ command-line option.

        For functions that are <tt/cdecl/, the rightmost parameter is pushed
        onto the stack before the function is called. That increases the cost
        of calling those functions, especially when they are called from many
        places.<newline><newline>
        <p>

<item>	There are two pseudo variables named <tt/__AX__/ and <tt/__EAX__/.
	Both refer to the primary register that is used by the compiler to
	evaluate expressions or return function results. <tt/__AX__/ is of
	type <tt/unsigned int/ and <tt/__EAX__/ of type <tt/long unsigned int/
	respectively. The pseudo variables may be used as lvalue and rvalue as
	every other variable. They are most useful together with short
	sequences of assembler code. For example, the macro

	<tscreen><verb>
       	#define hi(x)           \
            (__AX__ = (x),      \
             asm ("txa"),       \
             asm ("ldx #$00"),  \
             __AX__)
	</verb></tscreen>

	will give the high byte of any unsigned value.
	<p>

<item>	Inside a function, the identifier <tt/__func__/ gives the name of the
	current function as a string. Outside of functions, <tt/__func__/ is
	undefined.
	Example:

	<tscreen><verb>
	#define PRINT_DEBUG(s)	printf ("%s: %s\n", __func__, s);
	</verb></tscreen>

	The macro will print the name of the current function plus a given
	string.
	<p>

<item> 	cc65 allows the initialization of <tt/void/ variables. This may be
	used to create variable structures that are more compatible with
	interfaces written for assembler languages. Here is an example:

	<tscreen><verb>
	void GCmd = {	(char)3, (unsigned)0x2000, (unsigned)0x3000 };
	</verb></tscreen>

	This will be translated as follows:

	<tscreen><verb>
	_GCmd:
	   	.byte	3
	   	.word	$2000
	   	.word	$3000
	</verb></tscreen>

	Since the variable is of type <tt/void/ you may not use it as is.
	However, taking the address of the variable results in a <tt/void*/
	which may be passed to any function expecting a pointer.

	See the <url url="geos.html" name="GEOS library document"> for examples
	on how to use this feature.
	<p>

<item>  cc65 implements flexible array struct members as defined in the C99 ISO
        standard. As an extension, these fields may be initialized. There are
        several exceptions, however (which is probably the reason why the
        standard does not define this feature, because it is highly
        unorthogonal). Flexible array members cannot be initialized ...

        <itemize>
        <item>... when defining an array of structs with flexible
                members.
        <item>... if such a struct is a member field of another struct
                which is not the last field.
        <item>... if the struct which contains a flexible array member is
                declared as <tt/register/, and the size and compiler settings
                do allow the compiler actually to place the struct into the
                register bank in the zero page.
        </itemize>

        Please note that -- as defined in the ISO C standard -- the <tt/sizeof/
        operator returns the struct size with the flexible array member having
        size zero, even if it is initialized.
        <p>

</descrip>


<sect>&num;pragmas<label id="pragmas"><p>

The compiler understands some pragmas that may be used to change code
generation and other stuff. Some of these pragmas understand a special form:
If the first parameter is <tt/push/, the old value is saved onto a stack
before changing it. The value may later be restored by using the <tt/pop/
parameter with the <tt/#pragma/.

<sect1><tt>#pragma bss-name (&lsqb;push,&rsqb; &lt;name&gt;)</tt><label id="pragma-bss-name"><p>

  This pragma changes the name used for the BSS segment (the BSS segment
  is used to store uninitialized data). The argument is a string enclosed
  in double quotes.

  Note: The default linker configuration file does only map the standard
  segments. If you use other segments, you have to create a new linker
  configuration file.

  Beware: The startup code will zero only the default BSS segment. If you
  use another BSS segment, you have to do that yourself, otherwise
  uninitialized variables do not have the value zero.

  The <tt/#pragma/ understands the push and pop parameters as explained above.

  Example:
  <tscreen><verb>
       	#pragma bss-name ("MyBSS")
  </verb></tscreen>


<sect1><tt>#pragma charmap (&lt;index&gt;, &lt;code&gt;)</tt><label id="pragma-charmap"><p>

  Each literal string and each literal character in the source is translated
  by use of a translation table. This translation table is preset when the
  compiler is started depending on the target system, for example to map
  ISO-8859-1 characters into PETSCII if the target is a commodore machine.

  This pragma allows to change entries in the translation table, so the
  translation for individual characters, or even the complete table may be
  adjusted.

  Both arguments are assumed to be unsigned characters with a valid range of
  1-255.

  Beware of two pitfalls:

    <itemize>
    <item>The character index is actually the code of the character in the
      	  C source, so character mappings do always depend on the source
      	  character set. This means that <tt/#pragma&nbsp;charmap/ is not
	  portable -- it depends on the build environment.
    <item>While it is possible to use character literals as indices, the
      	  result may be somewhat unexpected, since character literals are
      	  itself translated. For this reason I would suggest to avoid
      	  character literals and use numeric character codes instead.
    </itemize>

  Example:
  <tscreen><verb>
        /* Use a space wherever an 'a' occurs in ISO-8859-1 source */
       	#pragma charmap (0x61, 0x20);
  </verb></tscreen>


<sect1><tt>#pragma check-stack ([push,] on|off)</tt><label id="pragma-check-stack"><p>

  Tells the compiler to insert calls to a stack checking subroutine to detect
  stack overflows. The stack checking code will lead to somewhat larger and
  slower programs, so you may want to use this pragma when debugging your
  program and switch it off for the release version. If a stack overflow is
  detected, the program is aborted.

  If the argument is "off", stack checks are disabled (the default), otherwise
  they're enabled.

  The <tt/#pragma/ understands the push and pop parameters as explained above.

<sect1><tt>#pragma code-name ([push,] &lt;name&gt;)</tt><label id="pragma-code-name"><p>

  This pragma changes the name used for the CODE segment (the CODE segment
  is used to store executable code). The argument is a string enclosed in
  double quotes.

  Note: The default linker configuration file does only map the standard
  segments. If you use other segments, you have to create a new linker
  configuration file.

  The <tt/#pragma/ understands the push and pop parameters as explained above.

  Example:
  <tscreen><verb>
       	#pragma code-name ("MyCODE")
  </verb></tscreen>


<sect1><tt>#pragma codesize ([push,] &lt;int&gt;)</tt><label id="pragma-codesize"><p>

  This pragma allows finer control about speed vs. size decisions in the code
  generation and optimization phase. It gives the allowed size increase factor
  (in percent). The default is can be changed by use of the <tt/<ref
  id="option-codesize" name="--codesize">/ compiler option.

  The <tt/#pragma/ understands the push and pop parameters as explained above.


<sect1><tt>#pragma data-name ([push,] &lt;name&gt;)</tt><label id="pragma-data-name"><p>

  This pragma changes the name used for the DATA segment (the DATA segment
  is used to store initialized data). The argument is a string enclosed in
  double quotes.

  Note: The default linker configuration file does only map the standard
  segments. If you use other segments, you have to create a new linker
  configuration file.

  The <tt/#pragma/ understands the push and pop parameters as explained above.

  Example:
  <tscreen><verb>
       	#pragma data-name ("MyDATA")
  </verb></tscreen>


<sect1><tt>#pragma local-strings ([push,] on|off)</tt><label id="pragma-local-strings"><p>

  When "on", emit string literals to the data segment when they're encountered
  in the source. The default ("off") is to keep string literals until end of
  assembly, merge read only literals if possible, and then output the literals
  into the data or rodata segment that is active at that point.

  Using this <tt/#pragma/ it is possible to control the behaviour from within
  the source. When <tt/#pragma local-strings/ is active, string literals are
  output immediately, which means that they go into the currently active data
  or rodata segment, but cannot be merged. When inactive, string literals are
  remembered and output as a whole when translation is finished.


<sect1><tt>#pragma optimize ([push,] on|off)</tt><label id="pragma-optimize"><p>

  Switch optimization on or off. If the argument is "off", optimization is
  disabled, otherwise it is enabled. Please note that this pragma only effects
  whole functions. The setting in effect when the function is encountered will
  determine if the generated code is optimized or not.

  Optimization and code generation is also controlled by the <ref
  id="pragma-codesize" name="codesize pragma">.

  The default is "off", but may be changed with the <tt/<ref name="-O"
  id="option-O">/ compiler option.

  The <tt/#pragma/ understands the push and pop parameters as explained above.


<sect1><tt>#pragma rodata-name ([push,] &lt;name&gt;)</tt><label id="pragma-rodata-name"><p>

  This pragma changes the name used for the RODATA segment (the RODATA
  segment is used to store readonly data). The argument is a string
  enclosed in double quotes.

  Note: The default linker configuration file does only map the standard
  segments. If you use other segments, you have to create a new linker
  configuration file.

  The <tt/#pragma/ understands the push and pop parameters as explained above.

  Example:
  <tscreen><verb>
       	#pragma rodata-name ("MyRODATA")
  </verb></tscreen>


<sect1><tt>#pragma regvaraddr ([push,] on|off)</tt><label id="pragma-regvaraddr"><p>

  The compiler does not allow to take the address of register variables.
  The regvaraddr pragma changes this. Taking the address of a register
  variable is allowed after using this pragma with "on" as argument.
  Using "off" as an argument switches back to the default behaviour.

  Beware: The C standard does not allow taking the address of a variable
  declared as register. So your programs become non-portable if you use
  this pragma. In addition, your program may not work. This is usually the
  case if a subroutine is called with the address of a register variable,
  and this subroutine (or a subroutine called from there) uses
  register variables. So be careful with this #pragma.

  The <tt/#pragma/ understands the push and pop parameters as explained above.

  Example:
  <tscreen><verb>
       	#pragma regvaraddr(on) 	/* Allow taking the address
       		      	       	 * of register variables
       		      	       	 */
  </verb></tscreen>


<sect1><tt>#pragma register-vars ([push,] on|off)</tt><label id="pragma-register-vars"><p>

  Enables or disables use of register variables. If register variables are
  disabled (the default), the <tt/register/ keyword is ignored. Register
  variables are explained in more detail in <ref id="register-vars" name="a separate
  chapter">.

  The <tt/#pragma/ understands the push and pop parameters as explained above.


<sect1><tt>#pragma signed-chars ([push,] on|off)</tt><label id="pragma-signed-chars"><p>

  Changes the signedness of the default character type. If the argument is
  "on", default characters are signed, otherwise characters are unsigned. The
  compiler default is to make characters unsigned since this creates a lot
  better code. This default may be overridden by the <tt/<ref
  name="--signed-chars" id="option-signed-chars">/ command line option.

  The <tt/#pragma/ understands the push and pop parameters as explained above.


<sect1><tt>#pragma static-locals ([push,] on|off)</tt><label id="pragma-static-locals"<p>

  Use variables in the bss segment instead of variables on the stack. This
  pragma changes the default set by the compiler option <tt/<ref
  name="--static-locals" id="option-static-locals">/. If the argument is "on",
  local variables are allocated in the BSS segment, leading to shorter and in
  most cases faster, but non-reentrant code.

  The <tt/#pragma/ understands the push and pop parameters as explained above.


<sect1><tt>#pragma warn (name, [push,] on|off)</tt><label id="pragma-warn"><p>

  Switch compiler warnings on or off. "name" is the name of a warning (see the
  <tt/<ref name="-W" id="option-W">/ compiler option for a list). The name is
  either followed by "pop", which restores the last pushed state, or by "on" or
  "off", optionally preceeded by "push" to push the current state before
  changing it.

  Example:
  <tscreen><verb>
        /* Don't warn about the unused parameter in function func */
      	#pragma warn (unused-param, push, off)
        static int func (int unused)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        #pragma warn (unused-param, pop)
  </verb></tscreen>

<sect1><tt>#pragma writable-strings ([push,] on|off)</tt><label id="pragma-writable-strings"><p>

  Changes the storage location of string literals. For historical reasons,
  the C standard defines that string literals are of type "char[]", but
  writing to such a literal causes undefined behaviour. Most compilers
  (including cc65) place string literals in the read-only data segment, which
  may cause problems with old C code that writes to string literals.

  Using this pragma (or the corresponding command line option <tt/<ref
  name="--writable-strings" id="option-writable-strings">/) causes the
  literals to be placed in the data segment so they can be written to without
  worry.

  The <tt/#pragma/ understands the push and pop parameters as explained above.


<sect1><tt>#pragma zpsym (&lt;name&gt;)</tt><p>

  Tell the compiler that the -- previously as external declared -- symbol with
  the given name is a zero page symbol (usually from an assembler file).
  The compiler will create a matching import declaration for the assembler.

  Example:
  <tscreen><verb>
      	extern int foo;
      	#pragma zpsym ("foo");	/* foo is in the zeropage */
  </verb></tscreen>




<sect>Register variables<label id="register-vars"><p>

The runtime for all supported platforms has 6 bytes of zero page space
available for register variables (this could be increased, but I think it's a
good value). So you can declare register variables up to a total size of 6 per
function. The compiler will allocate register space on a "first come, first
served" base and convert any <tt/register/ declarations that exceed the
available register space silently to <tt/auto/. Parameters can also be
declared as <tt/register/, this will in fact give slightly shorter code than
using a register variable.

Since a function must save the current values of the registers on entry and
restore them on exit, there is an overhead associated with register variables,
and this overhead is quite high (about 20 bytes per variable). This means that
just declaring anything as <tt/register/ is not a good idea.

The best use for register variables are pointers, especially those that point
to structures. The magic number here is about 3 uses of a struct field: If the
function contains this number or even more, the generated code will be usually
shorter and faster when using a register variable for the struct pointer. The
reason for this is that the register variable can in many cases be used as a
pointer directly. Having a pointer in an auto variable means that this pointer
must first be copied into a zero page location, before it can be dereferenced.

Second best use for register variables are counters. However, there is not
much difference in the code generated for counters, so you will need at least
100 operations on this variable (for example in a loop) to make it worth the
trouble. The only savings you get here are by the use of a zero page variable
instead of one on the stack or in the data segment.

Register variables must be explicitly enabled, either by using <tt/<ref
name="-Or" id="option-O">/ or <tt/<ref name="--register-vars"
id="option-register-vars">/ on the command line or by use of <tt/<ref
name="#pragma register-vars" id="pragma-register-vars">/. Register variables
are only accepted on function top level, register variables declared in
interior blocks are silently converted to <tt/auto/. With register variables
disabled, all variables declared as <tt/register/ are actually auto variables.

Please take care when using register variables: While they are helpful and can
lead to a tremendous speedup when used correctly, improper usage will cause
bloated code and a slowdown.



<sect>Inline assembler<label id="inline-asm"><p>

The compiler allows to insert assembler statements into the output file. The
syntax is

<tscreen><verb>
      	asm (&lt;string literal&gt;[, optional parameters]) ;
</verb></tscreen>
or
<tscreen><verb>
       	__asm__ (&lt;string literal&gt;[, optional parameters]) ;
</verb></tscreen>
<p>

The first form is in the user namespace and is disabled by <tt><ref
id="option--standard" name="--standard"></tt> if the argument is not <tt/cc65/.

The asm statement may be used inside a function and on global file level. An
inline assembler statement is a primary expression, so it may also be used as
part of an expression. Please note however that the result of an expression
containing just an inline assembler statement is always of type <tt/void/.

The contents of the string literal are preparsed by the compiler and inserted
into the generated assembly output, so that the can be further processed by
the backend and especially the optimizer. For this reason, the compiler does
only allow regular 6502 opcodes to be used with the inline assembler. Pseudo
instructions (like <tt/.import/, <tt/.byte/ and so on) are <em/not/ allowed,
even if the ca65 assembler (which is used to translate the generated assembler
code) would accept them. The builtin inline assembler is not a replacement for
the full blown macro assembler which comes with the compiler.

Note: Inline assembler statements are subject to all optimizations done by the
compiler. There is currently no way to protect an inline assembler statement
from being moved or removed completely by the optimizer. If in doubt, check
the generated assembler output, or disable optimizations.

The string literal may contain format specifiers from the following list. For
each format specifier, an argument is expected which is inserted instead of
the format specifier before passing the assembly code line to the backend.

<itemize>
  <item><tt/%b/ - Numerical 8-bit value
  <item><tt/%w/ - Numerical 16-bit value
  <item><tt/%l/ - Numerical 32-bit value
  <item><tt/%v/ - Assembler name of a global variable or function
  <item><tt/%o/ - Stack offset of a local variable
  <item><tt/%g/ - Assembler name of a C label
  <item><tt/%s/ - The argument is converted to a string
  <item><tt/%%/ - The % sign itself
</itemize><p>

Using these format specifiers, you can access C <tt/#defines/, variables or
similar stuff from the inline assembler. For example, to load the value of
a C <tt/#define/ into the Y register, one would use

<tscreen><verb>
      	#define OFFS  23
       	__asm__ ("ldy #%b", OFFS);
</verb></tscreen>

Or, to access a struct member of a static variable:

<tscreen><verb>
      	typedef struct {
      	    unsigned char x;
      	    unsigned char y;
      	    unsigned char color;
      	} pixel_t;
      	static pixel_t pixel;
       	__asm__ ("ldy #%b", offsetof(pixel_t, color));
      	__asm__ ("lda %v,y", pixel);
</verb></tscreen>
<p>
The next example shows how to use global variables to exchange data between C
an assembler and how to handle assembler jumps:

<tscreen><verb>
        unsigned char globalSubA, globalSubB, globalSubResult;

        /* return a-b, return 255 if b>a */
        unsigned char sub (unsigned char a, unsigned char b)
        {
            globalSubA = a;
            globalSubB = b;
            __asm__ ("sec");
            __asm__ ("lda %v", globalSubA);
            __asm__ ("sbc %v", globalSubB);
            __asm__ ("bcs %g", jumpSubNoError);
            __asm__ ("lda #$FF");
        jumpSubNoError:
            __asm__ ("sta %v", globalSubResult);
            return globalSubResult;
        }
</verb></tscreen>
<p>

Arrays can also be accessed:

<p>

Note: Do not embed the assembler labels that are used as names of global
variables or functions into your asm statements. Code like this

<tscreen><verb>
        int foo;
        int bar () { return 1; }
       	__asm__ ("lda _foo");           /* DON'T DO THAT! */
        ...
        __asm__ ("jsr _bar");           /* DON'T DO THAT EITHER! */
</verb></tscreen>
<p>

may stop working if the way, the compiler generates these names is changed in
a future version. Instead use the format specifiers from the table above:

<tscreen><verb>
       	__asm__ ("lda %v", foo);        /* OK */
        ...
        __asm__ ("jsr %v", bar);        /* OK */
</verb></tscreen>
