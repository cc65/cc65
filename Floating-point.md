## cc65 floating point support

The current main goal is to implement IEEE754 support *in the compiler*, using
the "float" datatype as the common 32bit float.

*** ANYTHING ELSE COMES LATER ***

You can not use any of this to write software yet. Don't bother. This is for
people who want to help pushing the floating point support further.

You can however try the current state of development. You should be able to
build small (and slow...) programs that use floats on any supported target.

- Build the compiler/toolchain/libs from this fptest branch.
- Now you can build and run the samples and/or tests.
```
    samples/floattest.c
    samples/mandelfloat.c
    samples/mathtest.c
    samples/tgisincos.c
```
full math.h is available for C64 when linking agains fp754kernal.o (see below)

### Further info

- Right now by default all targets will use the Berkeley Softfloat Library. This
  solves the annoying "chicken and egg" problem of having to implement the float
  support both in the compiler and in the target library at the same time, before
  anything can be tested properly. Fortunately that also means we can use the
  simulator for running test programs, and test changes in the compiler using
  our test bench, and that against a library that is known to somewhat work
  correctly :)
- The default library also contains a collection of math functions (which i
  dubbed "softmath"), which may fill the gap until more targets have specific
  wrappers and/or a generic math library (in assembly) was written.
- The default library can be overridden by linking an override file, similar to
  how you can use the soft80 implementation for conio. Right now such override
  files are provided for the C64 (c64-fp754kernal.o) and VIC20
  (vic20-fp754kernal.o). The samples will automatically use the overrides.

### WANTED

- For the time being, i will not look at writing IEEE754 functions in assembly.
  Please see below for more info on what is needed to do this, should you be
  interested in doing this. Please contact me before you are putting work into
  this, so we can discuss some things and prevent anyone wasting time :)

- It might be possible to produce a similar kernal- or OS- wrapper override file
  as the C64 one for other targets (or port the C64 one to other CBM targets).
  - If you create a new one, keep in mind that the compiler *right now* will
    currently work with IEEE754 floats, which your library calls must also work
    with (which will involve converting forth and back to whatever other format
    at runtime), and there is no easy way to change that.

### Roadmap

- Test/Fix using the Softfloat lib some more, fix as much tests as possible
- When all obvious tests have been created and work OK, we can merge
  - for the failing tests, create "negative" cases

After the merge, the following things can be done more or less independent from
each other (not necessarily by me :)):

- implement IEEE754 library
  - for generic support this will be the best compromise for standard compliance
    and speed, but will take more RAM than alternatives.
  - Once implemented, it will work for all targets.

- implement support for native FP routines
  - Some targets have FP routines in ROM (or OS) that can be used instead of
    providing our own in the library. This may or may not save RAM, and may or
    may not be faster than the default library.
  - The wrapper library must implement conversion from/to 32bit IEEE754

- implement support for native FP formats
  - for this the wrappers in fp.c must be used in the compiler at all places.
  - also we must *implement* the native format on the host in fp.c
  - if the native format uses a different number of bytes than 4 for its native
    format, we must add support for this in the compiler at various places
  - last not least a wrapper library that uses the native format must be created
  - it is not unlikely that we will need extra tests for the native format

## The Compiler

NOT WORKING YET:

    /test/val/float-basic-var-var.c                  +=, -=

    /test/val/float-basic-var-intvar.c               +=, -=
    /test/val/float-basic-var-intconst.c       *, /, +=, -=, *=, /=

    /test/val/float-basic-intvar-const.c             +=, -=, *=, /=
    /test/val/float-basic-intvar-var.c               +=,         /=
    /test/val/float-basic-intconst-var.c       *, /

    /test/val/float-cmp-const-intvar.c
    /test/val/float-cmp-intvar-const.c
    /test/val/float-cmp-var-intvar.c

- float values written as "12.34f" work, but "12.34" does not - should it?

TODO:

- more tests are needed
    - warnings
    - errors
    - register variables
    - more/all tests should check local/global/register variables

## The Library

### variants

The floating point support calls library functions for any operations on non
constant values.

#### softfloat

This is a Port of "Berkeley SoftFloat Release 2c". It is currently used by
default for all targets.

#### softmath

Contains a collection of math functions, (hopefully) enough to completely
implement math.h in C. This is currently used by default for all targets.

#### cbmkernal

This is a wrapper to the CBM kernal functions. This is fairly complete,
including math functions. To use this, link against c64-fp754kernal.o. The c64
samples will do this by default.

#### ieee754

This should become a freestanding IEEE754 library, which can completely replace
the softfloat (and softmath) library.

- basically everything missing except addition/substraction
  - compare functions are missing
  - mul, div functions are missing
  - type conversion functions are missing
