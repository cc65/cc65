Versions compiled for c64, c128, Plus/4, Apple 2, should be portable to
	other computers
Uses conio.
Compiled on cc65 2.12.0.

------------------------------------------------------------------
History:
1.0.0:
	*	First release.
1.0.0a:
	*	Finished documentation.  It was incomplete.
1.1.0:
	*	Optimized code.  Cut about 1k from the C64 demo before other
		modifications.  Also added optimizations recommended by
		Greg King, a user of Fields.
	*	Hard-coded screen size.  C128 and defaults to 80 column, other
		computers 40.  Apple 2 gets 24 lines, others 25.
	*	Added check box.
	*	Made return data external to field data.
	*	There was a bug where you couldn't type to the right of a
		text or number field.  That bug was fixed.
1.2.0:
	*	More optimizing.  Decreased C64 demo size from 9.74k to 9.19k
		before other improvements.
	*	Added menu support.
	*	Apple 2e support now tested.
1.2.1:
	*	Even more optimizing.
	*	Bug fixed with menu support.  It didn't deselect submenus
		properly after submenu cancel and reselection.
	*	Text/number edit field now inserts text instead of overwriting
		it.
	*	Apple 2 cursor now supported.
	*	Numbers are now signed.

1.2.2:
	*	Color definitions were moved out of the dialog struct
	*	Apple2e support now tested
	*	The byte order of the returned menu value was reversed
	*	Money fields are now supported
	*	Selection of 40- and 80-column modes now available on the
		C128 and Apple2e.

1.2.3:
	*	Plenty of optimizations
	*	I cleaned up the disabled code I left in during debugging.
	*	C128 and Apple2enh targets are now hard-coded for an 80-column
		screen.
	*	Removed the insert key support for text and number fields for
		efficiency

Known bugs:
	*	Support for pre-C64 CBM computers and Apple 2 non-enhanced 
		untested.
	*	Number overflows are not trapped

To Do:
	*	String compression
	*	Long suppport
	*	Limit field key entries (i.e. all caps, password,
		letters/numbers, digits only...)
	*	Custom-handling of field changes (Call user code on
		field change)
	*	Windows
	*	Menu routine calls menu code directly
	*	Field information update code called upon field edit.

To install:
1.	Download the ZIP file.
2.	Uncompress it, keeping directory structure intact, to a
	convenient directory on your computer, i.e. 
	cc65/lib/fields.
3.	Copy the contents of the distribution's lib directory
	to cc65's lib directory and the include directory to cc65's include
	directory.

Now the installation is complete.
