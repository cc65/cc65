<sect>Overview

<p>The Agat was a series of 8-bit computers produced in the Soviet Union from 1983 to 1993. 
It was based on Apple II architecture with all electronic components made in the Soviet Union except for 6502 microprocessors supplied by UMC (UM6502A).
<p>If compared to Apple II, Agat had many improvements such as color text mode, additional graphic modes and flexible memory controller. 
Agat-7 had an Apple II compatibility card called "Module 121", while Agat-9 had a built-in Apple II+ mode activated by soft-switch.
<p>All mass-produced Agat models were disk-based systems, 2K ROM contained only basic machine language monitor and disassembler. 
Agat-7 had 140K floppy-drive based on Apple DISK II, while Agat-9 was supplied with 840K drive having its own sector format and controller.
