             Now there are just so many ways to conjure up a floating point
             representation system that it's damned near impossible to guess
             what's going on by writing a program to interpret bit patterns.
             Further, the information isn't all that useful, if we consider
             the fact that machines that won't handle numbers between 10**30
             and 10**-30 are very hard to find, and that people playing with
             numbers outside that range have a lot more to worry about than
             just the capacity of the characteristic.

             A much more useful measure is the precision, which can be ex-
             pressed in terms of the smallest number that can be added to
             1. without loss of significance. We calculate that here, for
