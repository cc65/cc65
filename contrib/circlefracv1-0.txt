*** Circle Frac V1.0 by Monte Carlos / Cascade ***

Recursively drawing of circles using the "tiny graphics interface"(TGI) for CC65.
Tested on C64(VIC, 320x200), C128 (VDC, 640x200 and 640x480).

Simply compile with:
cl65 -tC64|C128 -Oirs -o circlefrac

The program uses command line args to let the user specify how to draw the circles.
If you just type RUN, after you loaded the program with the C64/C128, you get a
short explanation on how to use these args.

The TGI Routines load the standard driver for the specified system. This is
"c64-hi.tgi" on the C64 platform and "c128-vdc.tgi" (640x200) on the C128 platform.
If you want to use the 640x480 resolution, just rename the TGI driver "c128-vdc.tgi" to
"c128-vdc1.tgi" and the driver "C128-vdc2.tgi" to "c128-vdc.tgi" so that the
program "thinks" it would still load the standard driver.
If you want to use 640x200 resolution again, just undo renaming of the drivers.
There is currently no way to detect, which drivers are available on which platform. So made the decision for this work around.
