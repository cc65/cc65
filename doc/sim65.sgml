<sect>Overview<p>


sim65 is the only solution as part of the toolchain to execute code. The
binary needs to be compiled with <tt/--target sim6502/ or <tt/--target sim65c02/.


<sect>Usage<p>

The simulator is called as follows:

<tscreen><verb>
	Usage: sim65 [options] file [arguments]
	Short options:
	  -h			Help (this text)
	  -v			Increase verbosity
	  -V			Print the simulator version number
	  -x <num>		Exit simulator after <num> cycles

	Long options:
	  --help		Help (this text)
	  --verbose		Increase verbosity
	  --version		Print the simulator version number
</verb></tscreen>


<sect1>Command line options in detail<p>

</descrip>


<sect>Input and output<p>

The simulator will read one binary file per invocation and can log the
program loading and paravirtualization calls to stderr.

<tscreen><verb>
sim65 --verbose --verbose samples/gunzip65
