# The following defines are only used by the 'atarixl' target:
#
# CHARGEN_RELOC  - If defined, CHBAS and CHBASE are updated when
#                  enabling or disabling the ROM.
#                  If the ROM is enabled, $E0 is written to CHBAS
#                  and CHBASE.
#                  If the ROM is disabled, the upper byte of
#                  __CHARGEN_START__ is written to CHBAS and CHBASE.
# USEWSYNC       - If defined, the code waits for horizontal retrace
#                  before switching the ROM and updating CHBAS and
#                  CHBASE. This define only has effect if CHARGEN_RELOC
#                  is also defined.

# Disabled by default, you should enable it if the linker script relocates the
# character generator (like atarixl-largehimem.cfg).
