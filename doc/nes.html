<EM>An overview over the NES runtime system as it is implemented for the
cc65 C compiler.</EM>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Overview</A></H2>


<P>This file contains an overview of the NES runtime system as it comes
with the cc65 C compiler. It describes the memory layout, NES specific header
files, available drivers, and any pitfalls specific to that platform.</P>
<P>Please note that NES specific functions are just mentioned here, they are
described in detail in the separate 
<A HREF="funcref.html">function reference</A>. Even functions marked as "platform dependent" may be available on
more than one platform. Please see the function reference for more
information.</P>


<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Binary format</A></H2>


<P>The standard binary output format generated by the linker for the NES target
is a machine language program with an INES cartridge header. It is of course
possible to change this behaviour by using a modified startup file and linker
config.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Memory layout</A></H2>


<P>cc65 generated programs with the default setup run with the I/O area and a
CHR bank enabled, which gives a usable memory range of $8000 - $FFF3.
All boot ROM entry points may be called directly without additional code.</P>
<P>Special locations:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Text screen</B><DD>
<P>The text screen is located at VRAM $2000.</P>

<DT><B>Stack</B><DD>
<P>The C runtime stack is located at $7FFF and growing downwards.</P>

<DT><B>Heap</B><DD>
<P>The C heap is located at the end of the program and grows towards the C
runtime stack.</P>

</DL>
</P>




<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Platform specific header files</A></H2>


<P>Programs containing NES specific code may use the <CODE>nes.h</CODE> header file.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 NES specific functions</A>
</H2>


<P>
<UL>
<LI>waitvblank</LI>
<LI>get_tv</LI>
</UL>
</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Hardware access</A>
</H2>


<P>The following pseudo variables declared in the <CODE>nes.inc</CODE> include file do
allow access to hardware located in the address space.</P>
<P>
<DL>

<DT><B><CODE>PPU</CODE></B><DD>
<P>The <CODE>PPU</CODE> defines allow access to the PPU chip.</P>

<DT><B><CODE>APU</CODE></B><DD>
<P>The <CODE>APU</CODE> defines allow access to the APU chip.</P>

</DL>
</P>




<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Loadable drivers</A></H2>


<P>All drivers must be statically linked because no file I/O is available.
The names in the parentheses denote the symbols to be used for static linking of the drivers.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Graphics drivers</A>
</H2>


<P>
<DL>

<DT><B><CODE>nes-64-56-2.tgi (nes_64_56_2)</CODE></B><DD>
<P>This driver features a resolution of 64&times;56 with 2 colors using the
CHR bank.</P>

</DL>
</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Extended memory drivers</A>
</H2>


<P>No extended memory drivers are currently available for the NES.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Joystick drivers</A>
</H2>


<P>
<DL>

<DT><B><CODE>nes-stdjoy.joy (nes_stdjoy)</CODE></B><DD>
<P>A joystick driver for the standard four buttons joypad is available.</P>

</DL>
</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Mouse drivers</A>
</H2>


<P>No mouse drivers are currently available for the NES.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 RS232 device drivers</A>
</H2>


<P>No serial drivers are currently available for the NES.</P>



<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Limitations</A></H2>



<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Disk I/O</A>
</H2>


<P>The existing library for the NES doesn't implement C file
I/O. There are no hacks for the <CODE>read()</CODE> and <CODE>write()</CODE> routines.</P>
<P>To be more concrete, this limitation means that you cannot use any of the
following functions (and a few others):</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>fclose</LI>
<LI>fopen</LI>
<LI>fread</LI>
<LI>fprintf</LI>
<LI>fputc</LI>
<LI>fscanf</LI>
<LI>fwrite</LI>
<LI>...</LI>
</UL>
</P>
