<abstract>
ca65html is an assembly-source-to-HTML converter.  It is very useful if you
want to publish your assembler sources in the web.

<sect>Overview<p>

ca65html converts assembly source files written for use with the <tt/<url
url="ca65.html" name="ca65">/ crossassembler into HTML. It is a standalone
tool written in PERL; and as such, it does not understand the structure of
assembler sources in the same depth as ca65 does, so it may fail in very rare
cases. In all other cases, it generates very nice output.


<sect>Usage<p>

<sect1>Command line options in detail<p>

Here is a description of all the command line options:

<descrip>

  <tag><tt>--bgcolor c</tt></tag>

  Set the background color. The argument c must be a valid HTML color, usually
  given as RGB triplet in the form <tt/#rrggbb/, where r, g, and b are the
  respective red, green, and blue parts as two-digit hex values. The default is
  <tt/#FFFFFF/ (white). That color is used in the <tt/&lt;body&gt;/ of the
  generated HTML output.


  <tag><tt>--colorize</tt></tag>

  Colorize the output. The converter outputs processor instructions, assembler
  control commands, and comments in different colors.


  <tag><tt>--commentcolor c</tt></tag>

  Set the color used for comments. The argument c must be a valid HTML color,
  usually given as RGB triplet in the form <tt/#rrggbb/, where r, g, and b are
  the respective red, green, and blue parts as two-digit hex values. The
  default is <tt/#B22222/ (red).

  Note that this option has no effect if <tt/--colorize/ is not also given.


  <tag><tt>--crefs</tt></tag>

  Generate references to the C file, when a <tt/.dbg/ command is found with a
  file name. The converter assumes that the C source was also converted into
  HTML (for example by use of <tt/c2html/), has the name <tt/file.c.html/, and
  lives in the same directory as the assembler file. If the <tt/.dbg/
  directive specifies a line, a link to the correct line in the C file is
  generated, using a label in the form <tt/linexxx/, as it is created by
  <tt/c2html/ by use of the <tt/-n/ option.


  <tag><tt>--commentcolor c</tt></tag>

  Set the color used for assembler control commands. The argument c must be a
  valid HTML color, usually given as RGB triplet in the form <tt/#rrggbb/,
  where r, g, and b are the respective red, green, and blue parts as two-digit
  hex values. The default is <tt/#228B22/ (green).

  Note that this option has no effect if <tt/--colorize/ is not also given.


  <tag><tt>--cvttabs</tt></tag>

  Convert tabs in the input into spaces in the output, assuming the standard
  tab width of 8. This is useful if the <tt/--linenumbers/ option is used to
  retain the indentation.


  <tag><tt>--help</tt></tag>

  Print the command line option summary shown above.


  <tag><tt>--htmldir dir</tt></tag>

  Specify an output directory for the generated HTML files.


  <tag><tt>--indexcols n</tt></tag>

  Use n columns on the index page. This option has no effect if used without
  <tt/--indexpage/.


  <tag><tt>--indexname name</tt></tag>

  Use another index file name instead of <tt/index.html/. This option has no
  effect if used without <tt/--indexpage/.


  <tag><tt>--indexpage</tt></tag>

  Causes the converter to generate an index page listing file names, and all
  exports found in the converted files.


  <tag><tt>--indextitle title</tt></tag>

  Use "title" as the title of the index page. This option has no effect if
  used without <tt/--indexpage/.


  <tag><tt>--keywordcolor c</tt></tag>

  Set the color used for processor instructions. The argument c must be a
  valid HTML color, usually given as RGB triplet in the form <tt/#rrggbb/,
  where r, g, and b are the respective red, green, and blue parts as two-digit
  hex values. The default is <tt/#A020F0/ (purple).

  Note that this option has no effect if <tt/--colorize/ is not also given.

  <tag><tt>--linelabels</tt></tag>

  Generate a label for each line using the name <tt/linexxx/ where xxx is the
  number of the line.

  Note: The converter will not make use of this label. Use this option if you
  have other HTML pages referencing the converted assembler file.


  <tag><tt>--linenumbers</tt></tag>

  Generate line numbers on the left side of the output.


  <tag><tt>--linkstyle n</tt></tag>

  Influences the style used when generating links for imports. If n is zero
  (the default), the converter creates a link to the actual symbol if it is
  defined somewhere in the input files. If not, it creates a link to the
  <tt/.import/ statement. If n is one, the converter will always generate a
  HTML link to the <tt/.import/ statement.


  <tag><tt>--replaceext</tt></tag>

  Replace the file extension of the input file instead of appending <tt/.html/
  when generating the output file name.


  <tag><tt>--textcolor c</tt></tag>

  Set the color for normal text. The argument c must be a valid HTML color,
  usually given as RGB triplet in the form <tt/#rrggbb/, where r, g, and b are
  the respective red, green, and blue parts as two-digit hex values. The
  default is <tt/#000000/ (black). This color is used in the <tt/&lt;body&gt;/
  of the generated HTML output.


  <tag><tt>--verbose</tt></tag>

  Increase the converter verbosity. Without this option, ca65html is quiet
  when working. If you have a slow machine and lots of files to convert, you
  might like a little bit more progress information.

</descrip>

<sect>Peculiarities<p>

<sect1>Cross links<p>

Since ca65html is able to generate links between modules, the best way to use
it is to supply all modules to it in one run, instead of running each file
separately through it.


<sect1>Include files<p>

For now, ca65html will not read files included with <tt/.include/. Specifying
the include files as normal input files on the command line works in many
cases.


<sect1>Conversion errors<p>

Since ca65html does not really parse the input, but does most of its work
applying text patterns, it doesn't know anything about scoping and advanced
features of the assembler. This means that it might miss a label.  And, it
might choose the wrong color for an item, in rare cases. Because it's just a
tool for displaying sources in a nice form, I think that's OK. Anyway, if you
find a conversion problem, you can send me a short piece of example input code.
If possible, I will fix it.


<sect1>Colorization<p>

While having colors in the output looks really nice, it has one drawback:

<enum>

<item>Because lots of <tt/&lt;span&gt;/ tags are created in the output,
the size of the output file literally will explode.  It seems to be the price
that you have to pay for color.

</enum>


<sect>Bugs/Feedback<p>

If you have problems using the converter, if you find any bugs, or if you're
doing something interesting with the assembler, I would be glad to hear from
you. Feel free to contact me by email (<htmlurl url="mailto:uz@cc65.org"
